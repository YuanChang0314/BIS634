        "ArticleTitle": "An Investigation into Race Bias in Random Forest Models Based on Breast DCE-MRI Derived Radiomics Features.",
        "AbstractText": "Recent research has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) models can exhibit bias in performance when trained using data that are imbalanced by protected attribute(s). Most work to date has focused on deep learning models, but classical AI techniques that make use of hand-crafted features may also be susceptible to such bias. In this paper we investigate the potential for race bias in random forest (RF) models trained using radiomics features. Our application is prediction of tumour molecular subtype from dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of breast cancer patients. Our results show that radiomics features derived from DCE-MRI data do contain race-identifiable information, and that RF models can be trained to predict White and Black race from these data with 60-70% accuracy, depending on the subset of features used. Furthermore, RF models trained to predict tumour molecular subtype using race-imbalanced data seem to produce biased behaviour, exhibiting better performance on test data from the race on which they were trained.",

        "AbstractText": "Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. On the other hand, in post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasn't available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7-252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patient's age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.",

Acute management has also seen major shifts, where traditional antibiotic treatment may no longer be necessary for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Following successful medical management of acute diverticulitis, indications for elective sigmoidectomy have decreased. The benefit of emergency surgery remains for peritonitis, sepsis, obstruction, and acute diverticulitis in certain immunocompromised patients. Routine colonoscopy, once recommended after all acute diverticulitis episodes, has been shown to be beneficial for cancer exclusion in a distinct patient population.

Therefore, this study compared the effects of two different anesthetic techniques on natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing open hepatic resection. Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic HCC were scheduled for hepatic resection and randomly assigned to receive either propofol- or desflurane-based anesthesia. The primary outcome was pre- and postoperative NKCC assay. Cytokine levels were assessed by measuring interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) levels, and the secondary outcome was postoperative cancer recurrence evaluated using diagnostic imaging scans for 2 years. Twenty-eight patients were analyzed, including 15 and 13 in the total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalation (INH) groups, respectively. Two patients in the INH group were excluded due to non-HCC postoperative pathologic results.

        "AbstractText": "As PET imaging is accompanied by substantial radiation exposure and cancer risk, reducing radiation dose in PET scans is an important topic. However, low-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively impact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for recovering underlying signal from noisy counterparts. However, neural networks trained on a specific noise level cannot be easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude and variances. To obtain optimal denoised results, we may need to train multiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may be infeasible in reality due to limited data availability. Denoising dynamic PET images presents additional challenge due to tracer decay and continuously changing noise levels across dynamic frames. To address these issues, we propose a Unified Noise-aware Network (UNN) that combines multiple sub-networks with varying denoising power to generate optimal denoised results regardless of the input noise levels. Evaluated using large-scale data from two medical centers with different vendors, presented results showed that the UNN can consistently produce promising denoised results regardless of input noise levels, and demonstrate superior performance over networks trained on single noise level data, especially for extremely low-count data.",

IONs were developed with a thin silica layer on their surface with MPTES (carrying -SH groups, IONs-SH), and they were coupled either with a pharmacophore targeting PSMA (IONs-PSMA) or with bombesin peptide (IONs-BN), targeting GRP receptors, or with both (IONs-PSMA/BN). The functionalized IONs were characterized for their size, zeta potential, and efficiency of functionalization using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). All the aforementioned types of IONs were radiolabeled directly with Technetium-99m (99mTc) and evaluated for their radiolabeling efficiency, stability, and binding ability on two different PCa cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP). The MTT assay demonstrated low toxicity of the IONs against PC3 and LNCaP cells, while the performed wound-healing assay further proved that these nanostructures did not affect cellular growth mechanisms. The observed hemolysis ratio after co-incubation with red blood cells was extremely low. Furthermore, the 99mTc-radiolabeled IONs showed good stability in human serum, DTPA, and histidine, and high specific binding rates in cancer cells, supporting their future utilization as potential diagnostic tools for PCa with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging.",

At advanced stages, oral cancer imparts significant mortality, morbidity, and mutilation among the patients, and therefore, diagnosis and treatment of the disease at early stages are considered the optimum strategy for the management of the disease. Since molecular changes appear earlier than physical symptoms, several molecular biomarkers are currently being investigated for their role in diagnosing and treating disease. MMP-9 belongs to the family of proteinases that are involved in cytoskeletal degradation, which is a crucial phase of cancer progression. In the present study, we analyzed the serum concentration of MMP-9 in oral cancer patients and tried to establish MMP-9 as a predictive biomarker for the progression of oral cancer.\u00a0We also correlated the clinical, sociodemographic and\u00a0biochemical parameters with the serum concentration of MMP-9 in oral cancer patients.

The present study aimed to assess the shame and stigma over long-term postoperative survival duration in head and neck cancer patients. Total 100 postoperative patients of head and neck cancer were recruited from the outpatient department of the host institute, and shame and stigma was assessed using the Hindi version of the shame and stigma scale. The global shame and stigma score was 22.67\u2009\u00b1\u200916.22, with the highest perceived stigma due to changes in appearance (11.94\u2009\u00b1\u20098.805), followed by impaired speech (4.490\u2009\u00b1\u20093.243), feeling of regret (3.950\u2009\u00b1\u20093.313), and feeling of\u00a0stigma (4.490\u2009\u00b1\u20093.243).

Validation of the exomap1 mouse with eight distinct Cre drivers demonstrated that HsCD81mNG was expressed only in response to Cre, that murine cells correctly localized HsCD81mNG to the plasma membrane, and that this led to the secretion of HsCD81mNG in EVs that had the size (~70-80 nm), topology, and composition of exosomes. Furthermore, cell type-specific activation of the exomap1 transgene allowed us to use quantitative single molecule localization microscopy to calculate the cell type-specific contribution to biofluid exosome populations.

Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway-related genes are associated with multiple tumors, but their role in prognosis prediction and tumor microenvironment (TME) regulation in colon cancer is poorly understood. Using bioinformatics, this study aimed to construct a risk prediction signature for colon cancer, which may provide a means for developing new effective treatment strategies. Using consensus clustering, patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with colon adenocarcinoma were classified into several subtypes based on the expression of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-related genes, and differences in survival, molecular, and immunological TME characteristics and drug sensitivity were examined in each subtype. Ten genes that make up a TGF-\u03b2-related predictive signature were found by least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) regression using colon cancer data from the TCGA database and confirmed using a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. A nomogram incorporating risk scores and clinicopathologic factors was developed to stratify the prognosis of patients with colon cancer for accurate clinical diagnosis and therapy. Two TGF-\u03b2 subtypes were identified, with the TGF-\u03b2-high subtype being associated with a poorer prognosis and superior sensitivity to immunotherapy. Mutation analyses showed a high incidence of gene mutations in the TGF-\u03b2-high subtype. After completing signature construction, patients with colon cancer were categorized into high- and low-risk subgroups based on the median risk score of the TGF-\u03b2-related predictive signature. The risk score exhibited superior predictive performance relative to age, gender, and stage, as evidenced by its AUC of 0.686. Patients in the high-risk subgroup had higher levels of immunosuppressive cell infiltration and immune checkpoints in the TME, suggesting that these patients had better responses to immunotherapy. Patients with colon cancer were divided into two subtypes with different survival and immune characteristics using consensus clustering analysis based on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway-related genes. The constructed risk prediction signature may show promise as a biomarker for evaluating the prognosis of colon cancer, with potential utility for screening individuals for immunotherapy.",

In patients with advanced ESCC, the anlotinib plus camrelizumab group (N = 32) exhibited longer PFS (8.00 vs. 4.53 months, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), higher ORR (28.1 vs. 19.2%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.431), and higher DCR (87.5 vs. 65.4%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) than those in the anlotinib plus S-1 group (N = 26). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were predominantly grade 1/2 in both groups, with a higher incidence of grade 1/2 skin toxicity in patients treated with anlotinib plus camrelizumab (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Two patients (6.3%) developed grade 1/2 immune-related pneumonia. The incidence of grade 3/4 TRAEs did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified that the drug regimen (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and differentiation grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) were independent prognostic factors for PFS. Anlotinib plus camrelizumab exhibited promising antitumor efficacy and manageable toxicity when used as a second-line treatment for advanced ESCC.",

To invesigate these interactions requires in vitro co-culture models that closely mirror the actual TME in vivo. In this review, we summarize the two- and three-dimensional in vitro co-culture model systems for glioma-TME interactions currently available. Furthermore, we explore common glioma-TME cell interactions based on these models, including interactions of glioma cells/GSCs with endothelial cells/pericytes, microglia/macrophages, T cells, astrocytes, neurons, or other multi-cellular interactions.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer (BC) contributes greatly to global cancer incidence and is the main cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally. It is a complex disease characterized by numerous subtypes with distinct clinical manifestations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are not effective in all patients and have been associated with tumor resistance and immunosuppression. Because amino acid (AA)-catabolizing enzymes have been shown to regulate immunosuppressive effects, this review investigated the immunosuppressive roles of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme, which is overexpressed in various metastatic tumors. It promotes immunomodulatory effects by depleting Trp in the regional microenvironment. This leads to a reduction in the number of immunogenic immune cells, such as effector T and natural killer (NK) cells, and an increase in tolerogenic immune cells, such as regulatory T (Treg) cells. The BC tumor microenvironment (TME) establishes a supportive niche where cancer cells can interact with immune cells and neighboring endothelial cells and is thus a feasible target for cancer therapy. In many immunological contexts, IDO1 regulates immune control by causing regional metabolic changes in the TME and tissue environment, which may further affect the maturation of systemic immunological tolerance. In the development of effective treatment targets and approaches, it is essential to understand the immunomodulatory effects exerted by AA-catabolizing enzymes, such as IDO1, on the components of the TME.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Supplemental Screening as an Adjunct to Mammography for Breast Cancer Screening in People With Dense Breasts: A Health Technology Assessment.",
        "AbstractText": "Screening with mammography aims to detect breast cancer before clinical symptoms appear. Among people with dense breasts, some cancers may be missed using mammography alone. The addition of supplemental imaging as an adjunct to screening mammography has been suggested to detect breast cancers missed on mammography, potentially reducing the number of deaths associated with the disease. We conducted a health technology assessment of supplemental screening with contrast-enhanced mammography, ultrasound, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an adjunct to mammography for people with dense breasts, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, harms, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening, the preferences and values of patients and health care providers, and ethical issues. We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence published from January 2015 to October 2021. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias or RoBANS tools, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted cost-effectiveness analyses with a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography for people with dense breasts in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of supplemental screening for dense breasts, we spoke with people with dense breasts who had undergone supplemental screening; performed a rapid review of the qualitative literature; and conducted an ethical analysis of supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography. We included eight primary studies in the clinical evidence review. No studies evaluated contrast-enhanced mammography. Nonrandomized and randomized evidence (GRADE: Very low to Moderate) suggests that mammography plus ultrasound was more sensitive and less specific, and detected more cancers compared to mammography alone. Fewer interval cancers occurred after mammography plus ultrasound (GRADE: Very low to Low), but recall rates were nearly double that of mammography alone (GRADE: Very low to Moderate). Evidence of Low to Very low quality suggested that compared with supplemental DBT, supplemental ultrasound was more sensitive, detected more cancers, and led to more recalls. Among people with extremely dense breasts, fewer interval cancers occurred after mammography plus supplemental MRI compared to mammography alone (GRADE: High). Supplemental MRI after negative mammography was highly accurate in people with extremely dense breasts and heterogeneously dense breasts in nonrandomized and randomized studies (GRADE: Very Low and Moderate). In people with extremely dense breasts, MRI after negative mammography detected 16.5 cancers per 1,000 screens (GRADE: Moderate), and up to 9.5% of all people screened were recalled (GRADE: Moderate). Contrast-related adverse events were infrequent (GRADE: Moderate). No study reported psychological impacts, breast cancer-specific mortality, or overall mortality.We included nine studies in the economic evidence, but none of the study findings was directly applicable to the Ontario context. Our lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses showed that supplemental screening with ultrasound, MRI, or DBT found more screen-detected cancers, decreased the number of interval cancers, had small gains in life-years or quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and was associated with savings in cancer management costs. However, supplemental screening also increased imaging costs and the number of false-positive cases. Compared to mammography alone, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound, MRI, or DBT for people with dense breasts were $119,943, $314,170, and $212,707 per QALY gained, respectively. The ICERs for people with extremely dense breasts were $83,529, $101,813, and $142,730 per QALY gained, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, the diagnostic test sensitivity of mammography alone and of mammography plus supplemental screening had the greatest effect on ICER estimates. The total budget impact of publicly funding supplemental screening with handheld ultrasound, MRI, or DBT for people with dense breasts over the next 5 years is estimated at $15 million, $41 million, or $33 million, respectively. The corresponding total budget impact for people with extremely dense breasts is $4 million, $10 million, or $9 million.We engaged directly with 70 people via interviews and an online survey. The participants provided diverse perspectives on broad access to supplemental screening for people with dense breasts in Ontario. Themes discussed in the interviews included self-advocacy, patient-doctor partnership, preventive care, and a shared preference for broad access to screening modalities that are clinically effective in detecting breast cancer in people with dense breasts.We included 10 studies in the qualitative evidence rapid review. Thematic synthesis of these reports yielded three analytical themes: coming to know and understand breast density, which included introductions to and making sense of breast density; experiences of vulnerability, which influenced or were influenced by understandings and misunderstandings of breast density and responses to breast density; and choosing supplemental screening, which was influenced by knowledge and perception of the risks and benefits of supplemental screening, and the availability of resources.The ethics review determined that the main harms of supplemental screening for people with dense breasts are false-positives and overdiagnosis, both of which lead to unnecessary and burdensome health care treatments. Screening programs raise inherent tensions between individual- and population-level interests; they may yield population-level benefit, but are statistically of very little benefit to individuals. Entrenched cultural beliefs about the value of breast cancer screening, combined with uncertainty about the effects of supplemental screening on some outcomes and the discomfort of many health care providers in discussing screening options for people with dense breasts suggest that it may be difficult to ensure that patients can provide informed consent to engage in supplemental screening. Funding supplemental screening for people with dense breasts may lead to improved equity in the effectiveness of identifying cancers in people with dense breasts (compared to mammography alone), but it is not clear whether it would lead to equity in terms of improved survival and decreased morbidity. Supplemental screening with ultrasound, DBT, or MRI as an adjunct to mammography detected more cancers and increased the number of recalls and biopsies, including false-positive results. Fewer interval cancers tended to occur after supplemental screening compared to mammography alone. It is unclear whether supplemental screening as an adjunct to mammography would reduce breast cancer-related or overall mortality among people with dense breasts.Supplemental screening with ultrasound, DBT, or MRI as an adjunct to mammography in people aged 50 to 74 years improved cancer detection but increased costs. Depending on the type of imaging modality, publicly funding supplemental screening in Ontario over the next 5 years would require additional total costs between $15 million and $41 million for people with dense breasts, and between $4 million and $10 million for people with extremely dense breasts.The people we engaged with directly valued the potential clinical benefits of supplemental screening and emphasized that patient education and equitable access should be a requirement for implementation in Ontario. Our review of the qualitative literature found that the concept of breast density is poorly understood, both by people with dense breasts and by some general practitioners. People with dense breasts who receive routine mammography (especially those who receive health care in their nonpreferred language or are perceived to have lower economic status or health literacy) and their general practitioners may not have the awareness or knowledge to make informed decisions about supplemental screening. Some people with dense breasts experienced emotional distress from barriers to accessing supplemental screening, and many wanted to engage in supplemental screening, even when educated about its potential harms, including false-positives and overdiagnosis.Given an overall lack of robust evidence about morbidity and mortality associated with supplemental screening for people with dense breasts, it is not possible to determine whether funding supplemental screening for dense breasts delivers on the ethical duties to maximize benefits and minimize harms for populations and individuals. It is likely that existing inequities in access to breast screening and cancer treatment will persist, even if supplemental screening for dense breasts is funded. Continued efforts to address these inequities by removing barriers to screening might mitigate this concern. It will be important to identify and minimize sources of uncertainty related to benefits and risks of supplemental screening for dense breasts to optimize the capacity for everyone involved to live up to their ethical obligations. Some of these may be resolved with further evidence related to the outcomes of supplemental screening for dense breasts.",

Theragnostic is a term that refers to the integration of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into a single system for personalized medicine. Theragnostic care in HCC involves the use of imaging techniques to diagnose the cancer and assess its characteristics, such as size, location, and extent of spread. Theragnostics involves the use of molecular and genetic tests to identify specific biomarkers that can help guide treatment decisions and, post-treatment, assess the dosimetry and localization of the treatment, thus guiding future treatment. This can be done through either positron emission tomography (PET) scanning or single photon emission tomography (SPECT) using radiolabeled tracers that target specific molecules expressed by HCC cells or radioembolization. This technique can help identify the location and extent of the cancer, as well as provide information on the tumor's metabolic activity and blood supply.

        "AbstractText": "Ionizing radiation and microgravity are two considerable health risks encountered during deep space exploration. Both have deleterious effects on the human body. On one hand, weightlessness is known to induce a weakening of the immune system, delayed wound healing and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor deconditioning. On the other hand, radiation exposure can lead to long-term health effects such as cancer and cataracts as well as have an adverse effect on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Ionizing radiation originates from three main sources in space: galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle events and solar winds. Furthermore, inside the spacecraft and inside certain space habitats on Lunar and Martian surfaces, the crew is exposed to intravehicular radiation, which arises from nuclear reactions between space radiation and matter. Besides the approaches already in use, such as radiation shielding materials (such as aluminium, water or polyethylene), alternative shielding materials (including boron nanotubes, complex hybrids, composite hybrid materials, and regolith) and active shielding (using fields to deflect radiation particles) are being investigated for their abilities to mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation. From a biological point of view, it can be predicted that exposure to ionizing radiation during missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will affect the human body in undesirable ways, e.g., increasing the risks of cataracts, cardiovascular and central nervous system diseases, carcinogenesis, as well as accelerated ageing. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the risks related to deep space exploration and to develop mitigation strategies to reduce these risks to a tolerable level. By using biomarkers for radiation sensitivity, space agencies are developing extensive personalised medical examination programmes to determine an astronaut's vulnerability to radiation. Moreover, researchers are developing pharmacological solutions (e.g., radioprotectors and radiomitigators) to proactively or reactively protect astronauts during deep space exploration. Finally, research is necessary to develop more effective countermeasures for use in future human space missions, which can also lead to improvements to medical care on Earth. This review will discuss the risks space travel beyond LEO poses to astronauts, methods to monitor astronauts' health, and possible approaches to mitigate these risks.",

Radionuclide therapy is a newly developed modality for the treatment of breast cancer in which radionuclides are delivered to tumors and/or tumor-associated targets either directly or using delivery vehicles. Radionuclide therapy has been proven to be eminently effective and to exhibit low toxicity when eliminating both primary tumors and metastases and even undetected tumors. In addition, the specific interaction between the surface modules of the delivery vehicles and the targets on the surface of tumor cells enables radionuclide targeting therapy, and this represents an exceptional potential for this treatment in breast cancer.

The aim of this study is to investigate the value of radiomic parameters extracted from pretreatment 68Ga-PSMA PET images for the prediction of treatment response. A total of 45 mCRPC patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 from two university hospital centers were retrospectively reviewed for this study. Radiomic features were extracted from the volumetric segmentations of metastases in the bone. A random forest model was trained and validated to predict treatment response based on age and conventionally used PET parameters, radiomic features and combinations thereof. Further, overall survival was predicted by using the identified radiomic signature and compared to a Cox regression model based on age and PET parameters. The machine learning model based on a combined radiomic signature of three features and patient age achieved an AUC of 0.82 in 5-fold cross-validation and outperformed models based on age and PET parameters or radiomic features (AUC, 0.75 and 0.76, respectively). A Cox regression model based on this radiomic signature showed the best performance to predict overall survival (C-index, 0.67).

NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.",

        "AbstractText": "When analyzing data combined from multiple sources (e.g., hospitals, studies), the heterogeneity across different sources must be accounted for. In this paper, we consider high-dimensional linear regression models for integrative data analysis. We propose a new adaptive clustering penalty (ACP) method to simultaneously select variables and cluster source-specific regression coefficients with sub-homogeneity. We show that the estimator based on the ACP method enjoys a strong oracle property under certain regularity conditions. We also develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parameter estimation. We conduct simulation studies to compare the performance of the proposed method to three existing methods (a fused LASSO with adjacent fusion, a pairwise fused LASSO, and a multi-directional shrinkage penalty method). Finally, we apply the proposed method to the multi-center Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial to identify sub-homogeneity in the treatment effects across different study sites.",

The authors conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate differences in clinical outcomes. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: ADM with or without basement membrane. Both groups underwent immediate prepectoral direct-to-implant breast reconstruction.

The malignancy rate on final pathology of 159 patients was 24.5%. Malignancy rates were found to be higher in patients with HT coexistence (30.7% vs. 21.5%, p=0.20). Poor prognostic factors such as multifocality, number of metastatic lymph nodes (p=0.04), and extrathyroidal extension were more common in patients with cancer in the pathology specimen who were in the non-HT group. It cannot be said that HT decreases diagnostic value of FNAB in lesions diagnosed with AUS-FLUS.

        "AbstractText": "In contrast to tumors in children, between 6% and 20% of all brain tumors in adults arise solitary in the posterior cranial fossa. Given their rarity in adults, as well as the importance and complexity of their treatment, this paper reviews and discusses the clinical and surgical characteristics of such tumors. In a retrospective single-institution observational study, adult patients with posterior fossa tumors treated surgically over a ten-year period were analyzed. The characteristics observed were age and gender distribution, clinical symptoms, histopathologic tumor type, tumor size, location and extent of surgical resection, tumor recurrence and postoperative complications, as well as surgical outcome. Sixty-six patients who underwent surgical treatment were diagnosed with a tumor in the posterior fossa. The mean age was 63 years, and patients were evenly distributed by gender. The most common histopathologic type was metastatic tumor (59.1%), whereas meningioma was the most common primary brain tumor (16.6%) recorded. Most patients presented with vegetative and cerebellar symptoms in general and cranial nerve palsy, especially in the occurrence of vestibular schwannoma. In conclusion, posterior fossa tumors grow in a confined space and therefore may directly threaten vital centers in their immediate vicinity. Thus, it is crucial to schedule an appropriate surgical intervention as soon as possible, as it can significantly improve treatment outcome and prognosis of the disease. If possible, meticulous total tumor resection should be the treatment of choice. In the case of hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt should be considered as an alternative surgical option after tumor resection.",

In the study, eleven subjects were selected from native Tibetan middle-to-long distance runners to participate in an 8-week pre-competition exercise training program consisting of a 6-week training stage in Kangding City at an altitude of 2 560 meters (m) and a subsequent 2-week training stage in Leshan City at an altitude of 360\u00a0\u200bm. Blood samples were collected twice from the runners before beginning altitude exercise training in Kangding and after going to sea level - Leshan City. Using a label-free quantitative method, peptides in the samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins and predict their biological functions. A total of 846 proteins were identified in the 21 samples, including 719 quantified proteins. In total, 49 significantly differentially expressed proteins (p\u00a0\u200b<\u00a0\u200b0.05) were identified, including twenty-eight 0.2-fold up-regulated proteins or twenty-one 0.17-fold down-regulated proteins. The up-regulated proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and carbonic anhydrase I (CAI), were of particular interest due to their role in regulating the oxygen saturation in deep tissues. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were mainly involved in regulating actin cytoskeleton, local adhesion, biotin absorption and metabolism, immune system, cancer, and membrane transport processes. In conclusion, Tibetan middle-to-long distance runners who resided in high-altitude areas benefited from repeated plateau-plain alternate training mode during the pre-competition period. The training mode induced positive changes in peripheral blood plasma proteins (CFTR and CAI), the biomarkers associated with aerobic capacity. Among the 11 runners, one female athlete won the gold medal in the 3 000-m running event in this competition, demonstrating that the plateau-plain alternate training mode could enhance the aerobic capacity of athletes.",

In the absence of competition from native production of this intermediate, the most efficient utilization of these externally-supplied structural analogues for precursor-directed biosynthesis becomes possible. To achieve this goal, we describe the required \u0394orf15 blocked mutant and a general synthetic route to a library of iodoanthracene structural variants.

In many applications, one is interested in linear transformations  \u03b2 \u22a4  x of regression coefficients \u03b2 \u2208 R p   , where x is a specific point and is not required to be identically distributed as the training data. One common approach is the plug-in technique which first estimates \u03b2 , then plugs the estimator in the linear transformation for prediction. Despite its popularity, estimation of \u03b2 can be difficult for high dimensional problems. Commonly used assumptions in the literature include that the signal of coefficients \u03b2 is sparse and predictors are weakly correlated. These assumptions, however, may not be easily verified, and can be violated in practice. When \u03b2 is non-sparse or predictors are strongly correlated, estimation of \u03b2 can be very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel pointwise estimator for linear transformations of \u03b2 . This new estimator greatly relaxes the common assumptions for high dimensional problems, and is adaptive to the degree of sparsity of \u03b2 and strength of correlations among the predictors. In particular, \u03b2 can be sparse or non-sparse and predictors can be strongly or weakly correlated. The proposed method is simple for implementation.

The current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms is still limited. One previous study showed that FKBP9 could confer glioblastoma cell resistance to ER stress through ASK1-p38 signaling. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of FKBP9 expression is still indistinct. In this study, we identified the FKBP9 binding proteins using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. Results showed that FKBP9 interacted with the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). BiP bound directly to FKBP9 with high affinity. BiP prolonged the half-life of the FKBP9 protein and stabilized the FKBP9 protein. BiP and FKBP9 protein levels were positively correlated in patients with glioma, and patients with high expression of BiP and FKBP9 showed a worse prognosis. Further studies showed that FKBP9 knockout in genetically engineered mice inhibited intracranial glioblastoma formation and prolonged survival by decreasing cellular proliferation and ER stress-induced CHOP-related apoptosis. Moreover, normal cells may depend less on FKBP9, as shown by the absence of apoptosis upon FKBP9 knockdown in a non-transformed human cell line and overall normal development in homozygous knockout mice. These findings suggest an important role of BiP-regulated FKBP9-associated signaling in glioma progression and the BiP-FKBP9 axis may be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.",

Although SUI can occur after surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically transurethral prostate resection, laser enucleation of the prostate, and simple open prostatectomy, these therapeutic modalities play a much less significant role in the etiology of SUI. Artificial urethral sphincter (AUS) implantation is considered the standard treatment modality providing high success rates, including durable efficacy, and optimal patient satisfaction for moderate to severe urinary incontinence resulting mainly from radical prostatectomy. However, although complication rates are generally acceptably low, revision and/or explantation may be required due to mechanical failure and non-mechanical problems, specifically urethral atrophy/cuff deficient occlusion, infection, and cuff erosion. Several risk factors for AUS failure associated with a fragile, compromised urethra have been identified and these play a critical role in device cuff erosion and subsequent removal of the device. Among others, apparently the most impacting factors are irradiation, urethral stent placement, a previous AUS placement, and importantly presence of urethral stricture or prior urethroplasty. Generally, any clinical situation leading to a diseased urethra or lack of urethral integrity is associated with impaired local blood perfusion, and consequently lower success rates. The present review aims to evaluate the impact of the presence of prior urethral strictures and urethroplasty on the outcomes of AUS implantation on one hand, and vice-versa, the influence of AUS placement on later urethral stricture surgery, particularly following cuff erosion.",

Accordingly, there are several techniques to address recalcitrant SUI in the setting of a fragile urethra to afford an improved chance of return to continence. Here, we review characteristics of patients that are at higher risk for an untoward outcome following AUS implantation and further define strategies to promote optimal success with device implantation. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature and describe surgical options for male SUI in patients with known or anticipated urethral tissue compromise. A thorough literature review was completed by querying PubMed for relevant articles. Search terms included artificial urinary sphincter, failure, recalcitrant, urethral atrophy, fragile urethra, revision, radiation, cystectomy, incontinence, and/or urethroplasty published between 1975 and 2022. Options for management of the fragile urethra include cuff relocation, cuff downsizing, tandem cuff placement, transcorporal cuff placement, pressure regulating balloon exchange with increased or decreased pressure, bulbospongiosus preservation, sub-cuff ventral capsulotomy, urethral wrapping with graft, and in select cases, urinary diversion, or complete device removal with a return to SUI. Proper patient selection is paramount to optimize outcomes. Advantages and disadvantages of each strategy are reviewed. Numerous techniques are viable options for patients with recalcitrant SUI in the setting of a fragile urethra, but high-quality evidence with reproducible outcomes for many of these strategies remain limited. Proper patient selection as well as adequate counseling by experienced implant surgeons may help optimize outcomes. Further multi-institutional investigations with longer term outcomes are needed to improve patient selection and counseling with shared decision-making prior to any intervention.",

        "AbstractText": "College students are at an increased risk for trauma exposure (TE), as well as weight gain and subsequent obesity. Notably, existing research has demonstrated that TE is associated with subsequent obesity. However, there is a dearth of literature looking at this relationship in college students who are at increased risk. Given this increased risk, there is a need to identify protective factors in the wake of TE that may buffer against the adverse impacts of TE on physical health outcomes. As such, the aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between college onset TE on subsequent BMI, and to examine psychological resilience as a buffer in this relationship. Trauma exposed college students (N= 2,281, Mage=18.5, 61.6% female, 50.3% identifying as racial/ethnic minorities) completed measures of TE, weight, height, and resilience. Individuals completed measures at baseline and at spring follow-up time points each year after. Resilience was assessed using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), and both new onset TE and BMI were assessed at Y2, Y3, and Y4. There was no significant main effect of new onset TE on BMI, nor an interaction between resilience and new onset TE. There was a main effect of resilience on later BMI, whereby those with higher levels of reported resilience reported higher BMI in subsequent years (Y2: B=.36, p<.05; Y3: B= .37= p<.01). The positive association between resilience and BMI is not consistent with our hypotheses. Findings suggest that resilience does not buffer against physical health outcomes.",

In vivo fluorescence spectroscopy is an emerging optical technology that offers promise for the diagnosis of disease & has the capability to quickly, noninvasively and quantitatively probe the biochemical and morphological changes that occur as tissue becomes dysplastic. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from December 2019 to September 2021 in the OBGY Department, UISEMH, in collaboration with optical imaging laboratory, BIOPHOTONICS, IIT Kanpur. A fabricated in-house fluorescence spectroscope consisting of a laser diode (405\u00a0nm) as light source and a miniature spectrometer is used to detect fluorescence signal from the sample. Patient's cervix was examined in the OPD, using an optical handheld probe, which functions on the principle of polarized fluorescence spectroscopy. The tissues were examined and classified on the basis of varying patterns of polarized spectroscopy (co-polarized, cross-polarized and co-minus cross-polarized light). The results were compared with that of cytological, colposcopy and histopathological findings and on various demographic variables. In vivo handheld probe based on polarized fluorescence spectroscopy is an excellent screening technique. Co- and cross- polarized light has shown enhanced accuracy. Accuracy of co-minus cross-polarized light is poor. It is fast, noninvasive and quantitative and, with further developments, has the potential to become a regular screening tool in future.",

Despite this success, the challenge remains to link variant associations to genes, and underlying biological pathways. To identify coding variant associations which may pinpoint effector genes at both novel and previously established genome-wide association loci, we performed meta-analyses of exome-array studies for four glycemic traits: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, up to 144,060 participants), fasting glucose (FG, up to 129,665 participants), fasting insulin (FI, up to 104,140) and 2hr glucose post-oral glucose challenge (2hGlu, up to 57,878). In addition, we performed network and pathway analyses. Single-variant and gene-based association analyses identified coding variant associations at more than 60 genes, which when combined with other datasets may be useful to nominate effector genes. Network and pathway analyses identified pathways related to insulin secretion, zinc transport and fatty acid metabolism. HbA1c associations were strongly enriched in pathways related to blood cell biology. Our results provided novel glycemic trait associations and highlighted pathways implicated in glycemic regulation.

        "AbstractText": "Magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) is an emerging technological innovation with more and more institutions gaining clinical experience in this new field of radiation oncology. The ability to better visualize both tumors and healthy tissues due to excellent soft tissue contrast combined with new possibilities regarding motion management and the capability of online adaptive radiotherapy might increase tumor control rates while potentially reducing the risk of radiation-induced toxicities. As conventional computed tomography (CT)-based image guidance methods are insufficient for adaptive workflows in abdominal tumors, MRgRT appears to be an optimal method for this tumor site. The aim of this narrative review is to outline the opportunities and challenges in magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy in gastrointestinal cancers. We searched for studies, reviews and conceptual articles, including the general technique of MRgRT and the specific utilization in gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on pancreatic cancer, liver metastases and primary liver cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer. This review is highlighting the innovative approach of MRgRT in gastrointestinal cancer and gives an overview of the currently available literature with regard to clinical experiences and theoretical background. MRgRT is a promising new tool in radiation oncology, which can play off several of its beneficial features in the specific field of gastrointestinal cancers. However, clinical data is still scarce. Nevertheless, the available literature points out large potential for improvements regarding dose coverage and escalation as well as the reduction of dose exposure to critical organs at risk (OAR). Further prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the role of this innovative technology in gastrointestinal cancer management, in particular trials that randomly compare MRgRT with conventional CT-based image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) would be of high value.",

        "AbstractText": "The management of colorectal cancer liver metastases requires a multidisciplinary approach, which may incorporate systemic therapy, surgery, or local ablative therapies. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive highly conformal radiation technique that enables the delivery of large doses of radiation in a few fractions to well-defined targets using image-guidance and motion management. For selected patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases, stereotactic body radiation therapy can be delivered safely, with excellent long-term local control and overall survival. The purpose of this clinical practice review is to review the background, indications, and treatment details of stereotactic body radiation therapy for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. SBRT for colorectal cancer liver metastases may be considered for patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer in combination with surgery or other locally ablative therapies; for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection; or after failure of resection or other ablative therapies. When planning SBRT both a computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging simulation may be obtained, where feasible, for target delineation. One or 3 fraction SBRT can be considered for lesions away from the central liver and luminal organs at risk, whereas 5 fraction SBRT is preferred otherwise. Image-guidance and motion management strategies are essential components of liver SBRT and will guide the creation of relevant internal and planning target volume margins. For lesions in close proximity to or overlapping with organs-at-risk, the balance between adequate local control and potential for cure with potential acute and late toxicity must be carefully considered.",

Harnessing their antimicrobial powers, without driving excessive and damaging inflammatory responses, represents an attractive therapeutic possibility. The neutrophil population is increasingly recognised to be more diverse and malleable than was previously appreciated. Hypoxic signalling pathways are known to regulate important neutrophil behaviours and, as such, are potential therapeutic targets for regulating neutrophil antimicrobial and inflammatory responses. We used a combination of in vivo and ex vivo models, utilising neutrophil and myeloid specific PHD1 or PHD3 deficient mouse lines to investigate the roles of oxygen sensing prolyl hydroxylase enzymes in the regulation of neutrophilic inflammation and immunity. Mass spectrometry and Seahorse metabolic flux assays were used to analyse the role of metabolic shifts in driving the downstream phenotypes. We found that PHD1 deficiency drives alterations in neutrophil metabolism and recruitment, in an oxygen dependent fashion. Despite this, PHD1 deficiency did not significantly alter ex vivo neutrophil phenotypes or in vivo outcomes in mouse models of inflammation. Conversely, PHD3 deficiency was found to enhance neutrophil antibacterial properties without excessive inflammatory responses. This was not linked to changes in the abundance of core metabolites but was associated with increased oxygen consumption and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. PHD3 deficiency drives a favourable neutrophil phenotype in infection and, as such, is an important potential therapeutic target.",

Protein ubiquitination is an important class of post-translation modifications that have been found to be associated with various human diseases and cancer development. Recent studies have revealed that protein ubiquitination is involved in the progression of ovarian cancer and plays an important role in the tumor immune process. Moreover, the combination of ubiquitinase/deubiquitinase inhibitors and cancer immunotherapy approaches can effectively reduce treatment resistance and improve treatment efficacy, which provides new ideas for cancer treatment. Herein, we review the role of protein ubiquitination in relation to ovarian cancer immunotherapy and recent advances in the use of ubiquitinase/deubiquitinase inhibitors in combination with cancer immunotherapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Arsenic is a bladder carcinogen though less is known regarding the specific temporal relationship between exposure and bladder cancer diagnosis. In this study, we modeled time-varying mixtures of arsenic exposures at many historic temporal windows to evaluate their association with bladder cancer risk in the New England Bladder Cancer Study. We used arsenic exposure estimates up to 60 years prior to study entry and compared the goodness of fit of models using these mixtures to those using summary measures of arsenic exposures. We used the Bayesian index low rank kriging multiple membership model (LRK-MMM) to estimate the associations of these mixtures with bladder cancer and estimate cumulative spatial risk for bladder cancer using participants' residential histories. We found consistent evidence that modeling arsenic exposures as a time-varying mixture provided better fit to the data than using a single arsenic exposure summary measure. We estimated several positive though not significant associations of the time-varying arsenic mixtures with bladder cancer having odds ratios (ORs) of 1.03-1.14 and identified many significant and positive associations for an interaction among those who consumed water from a private dug well (ORs 1.28-1.60). Arsenic exposures 40-50 years before study entry received elevated importance weights in these mixtures. Additionally, we found two small areas of elevated cumulative spatial risk for bladder cancer in southern New Hampshire and in south central Maine. These results emphasize the importance of considering time-varying mixtures of exposures for diseases with long latencies such as bladder cancer.",

The WHO pain ladder has been used in practice to guide cancer pain management. A three-step ladder starts with NSAIDs and non-opioids for mild pain, weak opioids for mild to moderate pain and strong opioids for moderate to severe pain with the use of adjuvant medications such as TCAs and muscle relaxants at any stage for optimization (Fallon et al., Dec 2022) [2] We present a case of a patient with metastatic colon cancer who was admitted for intractable pain crisis and right sided L-5 radiculopathy secondary to epidural metastasis (Figs. 1 and 2). The patient's pain left her bedridden, unable to walk and remained refractory to an escalating intravenous opioid regimen and caudal epidural steroids. The patient subsequently underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) trial at level T-7 and achieved >80\u00a0% pain relief resulting in a markedly decreased opioid requirement and tremendous recovery of ambulatory function (Fig. 3). After sustained results, a permanent implant was placed at T-8 and patient remains discharged with functional restoration and continued pain improvement (Fig. 4). To our knowledge, this is a novel application of SCS for a refractory pain crisis secondary to a metastatic colon cancer induced radiculopathy presenting with severe functional impairment. As we transition away from opioid use, it is imperative as pain physicians, to investigate the potential of current as an alternative means of cancer pain management: a ubiquitous and challenging clinical conundrum.",

Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality for prostate cancer but carries a multitude of adverse effects, ranging from radiation cystitis to post-radiation neuropathy. Proton beam therapy has gained attention as a valuable alternative, due to its improved precision with targeted dose delivery and reduced toxicity. However, the risk for radiation-induced complications, such as radiation-induced lumbar radiculopathy, is not fully understood and requires further investigation. We present a 68-year-old man with delayed-onset lumbosacral polyradiculitis following proton precision beam therapy for localized prostate cancer. The patient underwent proton therapy treatment for the prostate and seminal vesicles with favorable results and tumor remission. However, five months after completing radiation therapy, the patient presented with chronic lower extremity pain, weakness, and bilateral lower extremity paresthesias. MRI showed diffuse hyperintensity of bilateral L5-S3 nerve roots and an intramuscular edema-like signal involving the bilateral obturator externus and internus muscles, likely due to radiation. Additionally, EMG findings suggested the presence of chronic bilateral L5 radiculopathy. The clinical manifestation of delayed-onset radiation-induced lumbosacral plexopathy is a rare and uncommon complication of external beam radiation therapy that presents as radicular or myelopathic symptoms based on the location and severity of the inflammation. This case highlights the need for continued follow-up post-radiation and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive review of the oncological history of cancer patients.",

Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) has been documented to help reduce perceived pain; however, few studies have analyzed the impact of perceived pain on opioid consumption before and after SCS. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of spinal cord stimulation on opioid consumption after permanent SCS implant. This IRB-approved retrospective single-center study investigated the opioid consumption of 26 adults at three different times: (1) Initial date of service-baseline- (2) SCS implant date, and (3) 6 months post-SCS implant date. Mean opioid consumption was calculated over the month prior and after to visit of (1), (2), and (3) to generate 3 separate month averages. Opioid consumptions were measured using Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME). To determine the difference in MME consumption from baseline to permanent SCS implantation, we conducted a series of paired-sample t-tests.

        "AbstractText": "Epigenetics, a field that investigates alterations in gene function that can be inherited without changes in DNA sequence, encompasses molecular pathways such as histone variants, posttranslational modifications of amino acids, and covalent modifications of DNA bases. These pathways modulate the transformation of genotypes into specific phenotypes. Epigenetics plays a substantial role in cell growth, development, and differentiation by dynamically regulating gene transcription and ensuring genomic stability. This regulation is carried out by three key players: writers, readers, and erasers. In recent years, epigenetic proteins have played a crucial role in epigenetic regulation and have gradually become important targets in drug research and development. Targeted therapy is an essential strategy; however, the effectiveness of targeted drugs is often limited by drug resistance, posing a significant dilemma in clinical practice. Targeted protein degradation technologies, including proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have great potential in overcoming drug resistance and targeting undruggable targets. These areas of research are gaining increasing attention to various epigenetic related disease. In this review, we have provided a summary of the recently developed degraders targeting epigenetic readers, writers, and erasers. Additionally, we have outlined new applications for epigenetic protein degraders. Finally, we have addressed several unresolved challenges within the PROTAC field and offered potential solutions from our perspective. As the field continues to advance, the integration of these innovative methodologies holds great promise for addressing the challenges associated with PROTAC development.",

We assessed pesticide exposure and related these exposures to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Latinx children from rural, farmworker families (FW; N\u2009=\u200930) and from urban, non-farmworker families (NFW; N\u2009=\u200915) living in North Carolina. DSBs were quantified in hair follicular cells by immunostaining of 53BP1, and exposure to 72 pesticides and pesticide degradation products were determined using silicone wristbands. Cholinesterase activity was measured in blood samples. DSB frequencies were higher in FW compared to NFW children. Seasonal effects were detected in the FW group, with highest DNA damage levels in April-June and lowest levels in October-November. Acetylcholinesterase depression had the same seasonality and correlated with follicular DNA damage. Organophosphate pesticides were more frequently detected in FW than in NFW children. Participants with organophosphate detections had increased follicular DNA damage compared to participants without organophosphate detection. Follicular DNA damage did not correlate with organochlorine or pyrethroid detections and was not associated with the total number of pesticides detected in the wristbands. These results point to rural disparities in pesticide exposures and their outcomes in children from vulnerable immigrant communities. They suggest that among the different classes of pesticides, organophosphates have the strongest genotoxic effects. Assessing pesticide exposures and their consequences at the individual level is key to environmental surveillance programs. To this end, the minimally invasive combined approach used here is particularly well suited for children.

        "AbstractText": "Variable importance is a key statistical issue in exposure mixtures, as it allows a ranking of exposures as potential targets for intervention, and helps to identify bad actors within a mixture. In settings where mixtures have many constituents or high between-constituent correlations, estimators of importance can be subject to bias or high variance. Current approaches to assessing variable importance have major limitations, including reliance on overly strong or incorrect constraints or assumptions, excessive model extrapolation, or poor interpretability, especially regarding practical significance. We sought to overcome these limitations by applying an established doubly-robust, machine learning-based approach to estimating variable importance in a mixtures context. This method reduces model extrapolation, appropriately controls confounding, and provides both interpretability and model flexibility. We illustrate its use with an evaluation of the relationship between telomere length, a measure of biologic aging, and exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans among 979 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In contrast with standard approaches for mixtures, our approach selected PCB 180 and PCB 194 as important contributors to telomere length. We hypothesize that this difference could be due to residual confounding in standard methods that rely on variable selection. Further empirical evaluation of this method is needed, but it is a promising tool in the search for bad actors within a mixture.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Globally, respiratory infections contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. However, genetic determinants of respiratory infections are understudied and remain poorly understood. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide association study in 19,459 hospitalised respiratory infection cases and 101,438 controls from UK Biobank (Stage 1). We followed-up well-imputed top signals from our Stage 1 analysis in 50,912 respiratory infection cases and 150,442 controls from 11 cohorts (Stage 2). We aggregated effect estimates across studies using inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses. Additionally, we investigated the function of the top signals in order to gain understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. Results: From our Stage 1 analysis, we report 56 signals at P<5\u00d710 -6, one of which was genome-wide significant ( P<5\u00d710 -8). The genome-wide significant signal was in an intron of PBX3, a gene that encodes pre-B-cell leukaemia transcription factor 3, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor. Further, the genome-wide significant signal was found to colocalise with gene-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) affecting expression of PBX3 in lung tissue, where the respiratory infection risk alleles were associated with decreased PBX3 expression in lung tissue, highlighting a possible biological mechanism. Of the 56 signals, 40 were well-imputed in UK Biobank and were investigated in Stage 2. None of the 40 signals replicated, with effect estimates attenuated. Conclusions: Our Stage 1 analysis implicated PBX3 as a candidate causal gene and suggests a possible role of transcription factor binding activity in respiratory infection susceptibility. However, the PBX3 signal, and the other well-imputed signals, did not replicate in the meta-analysis of Stages 1 and 2. Significant phenotypic heterogeneity and differences in study ascertainment may have contributed to this lack of statistical replication. Overall, our study highlighted putative associations and possible biological mechanisms that may provide insight into respiratory infection susceptibility.",

A descriptive population-based study that was based on secondary sources was carried out, which aimed at measuring the burden of the disease in the Colombian region of Orinoquia, using the simplified synthetic indicator of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of the global health estimation methodology. We used mortality records from the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) and service provision records from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia, both records from the year 2017, available on the Integrated Social Protection Information System. 288,740.2 DALYs occurred (95% UI 210,714.6-382,948.8), with higher reports for men (59%); group of non-communicable diseases accounted for 62.3% of DALYs (179,993.6, 95% UI, 115,030.2-268,405.0), followed by external cause injuries group which contributed 24.6% (71,000.0, 95% UI, 25,638.1-134,013.1), and group of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders which contributed 13.1% (37,746.0, 95% UI, 28,048.0-50,239.7). Interpersonal violence was the primary cause specific of DALYs with 9.8% of the burden, (28,290.0, 95% UI, 7,365.1-64,208.1). Most DALYs in Orinoquia are produced by non-communicable\u00a0diseases\u00a0(NCD), largely caused by neoplasms and cardiovascular disease, which increased with age. However, when considered by specific cause of illness or injury, interpersonal violence is indicated as the main cause of DALYs, affecting mainly young men, possibly as an expression of social inequality, substance use, criminality, and insecurity. It is important to highlight that this region has been recognized as an area of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and poverty.",

In this study, we used single-cell mass cytometry and adoptive transfer of B cell subtypes to NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice to identify B27+IgM+CD24hi cells as the major producers of IgMOSE in humans. Notably, these cells have characteristics of human circulatory marginal zone B (MZB) cells, which are known to be atheoroprotective IgM producers in mice. CD24 antibody treatment to reduce MZB cells and IgM in a hyperlipidemic humanized mouse model provides the evidence that MZB cells protect against vascular inflammation. Consistent with these findings, the frequency of B27+IgM+CD24hi cells (MZB) in patients inversely correlates with coronary artery disease severity.",

        "AbstractText": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is defined by the presence of a cancer-associated somatic mutation in white blood cells in the absence of overt hematological malignancy. It arises most commonly from loss-of-function mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A and TET2. CHIP predisposes to both hematological malignancies and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in humans. Here we demonstrate that loss of Dnmt3a in myeloid cells increased murine atherosclerosis to a similar degree as previously seen with loss of Tet2. Loss of Dnmt3a enhanced inflammation in macrophages in vitro and generated a distinct adventitial macrophage population in vivo which merges a resident macrophage profile with an inflammatory cytokine signature. These changes surprisingly phenocopy the effect of loss of Tet2. Our results identify a common pathway promoting heightened innate immune cell activation with loss of either gene, providing a biological basis for the excess atherosclerotic disease burden in carriers of these two most prevalent CHIP mutations.",

Here we show that MCM8 expression is significantly decreased in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) who developed coronary artery aneurysms. Mechanistically, we discovered that nitric oxide signaling promotes TRIM21-mediated MCM8 ubiquitination, which disrupts its interaction with MCM9 and promotes its cytosolic export. In the cytosol, MCM8 relocates to the mitochondria pore-forming proteins and promotes their ubiquitination by TRIM21. In addition, MCM8 directly recruits LC3 via its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif and initiates mitophagy. This suppresses mitochondrial DNA-mediated activation of type I interferon via cGAS and STING. Mice that are deficient in Mcm8, Trim21 and Nos2 or reconstituted with the East-Asian-specific MCM8-P276 variant develop more severe coronary artery vasculopathy in the Lactobacillus casei extract-induced KD model. Collectively, the data suggest that MCM8 protects vascular health in the KD setting.",

Patients with International Classification of Retinoblastoma groups C-E retinoblastoma at a single institution from 2001 to 2021 were categorized into two groups: primary enucleation and globe salvage. Hospital visits and treatments were compared to determine differences in care utilization. Costs per encounter were derived from billing data and multiplied by number of encounters to determine total costs in the first year of treatment. Groups were stratified by unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma, and visual acuity-based utility values were used to compare quality-adjusted life years to determine cost-effectiveness. Of 74 group C-E eyes of 70 patients, 55 eyes underwent primary enucleation and 19 eyes underwent globe salvage, 12 of which ultimately underwent secondary enucleation. Patients who underwent globe salvage had higher usage of systemic chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), more examinations under anesthesia (P < 0.001), fewer outpatient visits (P\u00a0= 0.03), and a higher total cost of care (301,151 vs 104,764 USD [P < 0.001]) in the first year of treatment compared with the primary enucleation group. At an average life expectancy of 76 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 118,347 USD per QALY in unilateral retinoblastoma and 32,987 USD per QALY in bilateral retinoblastoma, meeting the <150,000 USD/QALY threshold of cost-effectiveness. Incurring additional costs may save the eye in advanced retinoblastoma, but the possibility of secondary enucleation should be disclosed for informed decision making. Despite this risk, globe salvage was cost-effective in unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma.",

The prevalence of ICP use was estimated by categories of the other variables (presence or absence of chronic conditions) and prevalence ratios (PR) were adjusted for sociodemographic variables. The prevalence of the use of a given ICP, in the last 12 months, by the adult Brazilian population (18 years of age and over) was 5.5% (95%CI: 5.2%-5.8%), and adults with a chronic condition had a higher prevalence of use (PR: 2.11; 95%CI: 1.89-2.36), even after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.

Our research, which employed liquid-phase atomic force microscopy, revealed that lower-dimensional GOs create a more extensive nano-bio interface that impedes actin protein polymerization into the cytoskeleton, leading to the prevention of tumor metastasis.

        "AbstractText": "Complete regeneration of damaged tissues/organs has always been the ultimate challenge in regenerative medicine. Aging has long been considered the basis of age-related diseases, as senescent cells gradually accumulate in tissues with increasing age, tissues exhibit aging and normal physiological functions are inhibited. In recent years, in damaged tissues, scholars have found that the number of cells with features of cellular senescence continues to increase over time. The accumulation of senescent cells severely hinders the healing of damaged tissues. Furthermore, by clearing senescent cells or inhibiting the aging microenvironment, damaged tissues regained their original regenerative and repair capabilities. On the other hand, various biomaterials have been proved to have good biocompatibility and can effectively support cell regeneration after injury. Combining the two solutions, inhibiting the cellular senescence in damaged tissues and establishing a pro-regenerative environment through biomaterial technology gradually reveals a new, unexpected treatment strategy applied to the field of regenerative medicine. In this review, we first elucidate the main characteristics of senescent cells from morphological, functional and molecular levels, and discuss in detail the process of accumulation of senescent cells in tissues. Then, we will explore in depth how the accumulation of senescent cells after damage affects tissue repair and regeneration at different stages. Finally, we will turn to how to promote tissue regeneration and repair in the field of regenerative medicine by inhibiting cellular senescence combined with biomaterial technology. Our goal is to understand the relationship between cellular senescence and tissue regeneration through this new perspective, and provide valuable references for the development of new therapeutic strategies in the future.",

Hydrophilic random copolymers containing different ratios of polyethylene glycol methyl ether methacrylate and 2-aminoethylmethacrylamide were synthesized for conjugating with C60 molecules through efficient nucleophilic Michael addition reaction between amine groups from hydrophilic polymer and carbon-carbon double bonds from C60. As a result, the amphiphilic C60-polymer conjugates could be well dispersed and nano-assembled in water with a C60 concentration as high as 7.8\u00a0mg/mL, demonstrating a significant improvement for the solubility of C60 in an aqueous system. Owing to the high C60 content, the C60-polymer nanoparticles showed a strong photodynamic therapy effect on human lung cancer cells (A549) under light irradiation (450\u00a0nm) in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid culture, while demonstrating ignorable cytotoxicity under dark.

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (4- to 6-ring PAHs) were determined in fine and coarse particles. The gas/particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) of the PAHs were calculated from the supercooled liquid vapour pressure and octanol-air partitioning coefficient based on the relationships obtained in previous traffic pollution-related studies. Gaseous PAHs were estimated by Kp and the concentrations of PM and particulate PAHs. The concentrations of total PAHs were 32.5, 320.1 and 5646.2 pg/m3 in the PM>2.5, PM2.5 and gas phases, respectively. Significant seasonal trends in PAHs were observed (particle phase: lowest in summer, gas phase: lowest in spring, particle and gas phase: lowest in spring). Compared to 2019, the total PAH concentrations (in particles) decreased in 2020, especially in spring and summer, which might be due to reduced traffic trips during the COVID-19 outbreak. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) calculated from the toxic equivalent concentrations relative to benzo[a]pyrene (BaPeq) was lower than the acceptable limit issued by the US Environmental Protection Agency, indicating a low cancer risk in long-term exposure to current PAH levels. It is notable that gaseous PAHs considerably contributed to BaPeq and ILCR (over 50%), which highlighted the significance of gaseous PAH monitoring for public health protection. This low-cost estimation method for gaseous PAHs can be expected to reliably and conveniently obtain PAH concentrations as a surrogate for traditional sampling in the future work.",

With an increase in molecular testing to inform standard care and clinical trial participation, we show how practitioners \"potentialized\" the tissue by carefully negotiating what to test, how to test, and when. This included maximizing and managing small amounts of tissue in anticipation of possible future patient care. Tissue archives also took on new meaning, and potentiality, which practitioners negotiated alongside patient care. Potentiality was key to generating the \"big\" future of genomic medicine and also involved care work where the tissue emerged as an extension of the patient, as a form of \"material patienthood,\" to secure present and future care for patients through their involvement in genomic medicine.",

        "AbstractText": "Respiratory cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, but its statistics vary between the East and West. This study aimed to estimate the burdens of tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer and larynx cancer and their attributable risks from 1990 to 2019 in Asia, and at regional and national levels. This research evaluated the incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for respiratory tract cancers using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 database. Age-standardized rates were calculated for TBL cancer from 1990 to 2019, adjusted for smoking and socio-demographic index (SDI). Deaths from TBL cancer and larynx cancer attributable to each risk factor were estimated for 33 Asian countries. The age-standardized incidence and death rates for TBL cancer in Asia declined from 2010 to 2019, while the incidence rate of larynx cancer increased. Smoking was the leading specific risk factor for deaths from both TBL and larynx cancers. The burden of TBL cancer in Asian countries was influenced by SDI and smoking, particularly among males in Central Asia. Deaths, DALYs, and incidences of larynx cancer in East Asia had not changed significantly over the past 30\u00a0years, but showed slight downward trends in males and both sexes combined, and an upward trend in females in recent years. The past decade saw increases in numbers of incident cases and deaths from TBL cancer and larynx cancer in Asia. SDI and smoking were the main factors influencing the disease burden of TBL cancer in Asian countries. This study highlights the need for tailored cancer control programs to address the burden of respiratory tract cancers in different Asian countries.",

Hence, early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans are crucial to improving its 5-year survival rate. Chest computed tomography (CT) serves as an essential tool for lung cancer screening, and pathology images are the gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis. However, medical image evaluation relies on manual labor and suffers from missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and physician heterogeneity. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought a whole novel opportunity for medical task processing, demonstrating the potential for clinical application in lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning, have been deployed extensively for lung nodule detection, benign and malignant classification, and subtype identification based on CT images. Furthermore, AI plays a role in the non-invasive prediction of genetic mutations and molecular status to provide the optimal treatment regimen, and applies to the assessment of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of lung cancer patients, enabling precision medicine to become a reality. Meanwhile, histology-based AI models assist pathologists in typing, molecular characterization, and prognosis prediction to enhance the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment. However, the leap to extensive clinical application still faces various challenges, such as data sharing, standardized label acquisition, clinical application regulation, and multimodal integration.

        "AbstractText": "Although examinations and therapies for bronchial lung cancer, also called lung cancer (LC), have become more effective and precise, the morbidity and mortality of LC remain high worldwide. Describing the changing profile of LC characteristics over time is indispensable. This study aimed to understand the changes in real-world settings of LC and its characteristics in China. In this study, 119,785 patients were enrolled from 2012 to 2020 in the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital. The patients' medical records were extracted from the hospital's database. Demographic characteristics, general clinicopathological information, and blood coagulation indices at the initial diagnoses were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis, Nemenyi, chi-squared, and Bonferroni tests. Changes in demographic characteristics during the 8-year study period, namely dynamic changes among different stages and different pathological types, were evaluated. The percentages of female (from 38.50% [323/839] in 2012 to 48.29% [5112/10,585] in 2020) and non-smoking LC (from 69.34% [475/685] to 80.48% [8055/10,009]) patients increased significantly during the study period, with a trend toward a younger age at diagnosis (from 3.58% [30/839] to 8.99% [952/10,585]). Over the study period, the proportion and absolute number of lung adenocarcinoma cases increased (from 67.97% [433/637] to 76.31% [6606/8657]) while the proportion of lung squamous cell carcinoma decreased (from 21.19% [135/637] to 12.08% [1046/8657]). Comprehensive driver gene mutation examination became more common, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation occurred more frequently in female vs. male (62.03% [12793/20625] vs. 29.90% [8207/27,447]) and non-smoking vs. smoking (53.54% [17,203/32,134] vs. 23.73% [3322/13,997]) patients (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The distribution of the common driver genes differed among different stages of LC. EGFR mutation was detected most frequently at each stage, and other driver gene alterations were more common in advanced stages (P\u00a0<0.001). The combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, as a comprehensive management regimen, gradually became predominant over the study period (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A hypercoagulable state was shown in advanced-stage LC patients and patients with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion, indicated by significantly elevated levels of d-dimer, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen degradation products.

Immune checkpoint blockade and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have been successful in clinical trials. Cancer cells evade immune surveillance by hijacking inhibitory pathways via overexpression of checkpoint genes. The Cluster of Differentiation 47 (CD47) has emerged as a crucial checkpoint for cancer immunotherapy by working as a \"don't eat me\" signal and suppressing innate immune signaling. Furthermore, CD47 is highly expressed in many cancer types to protect cancer cells from phagocytosis via binding to SIRP\u03b1 on phagocytes. Targeting CD47 by either interrupting the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 axis or combing with other therapies has been demonstrated as an encouraging therapeutic strategy in cancer immunotherapy. Antibodies and small molecules that target CD47 have been explored in pre- and clinical trials. However, formidable challenges such as the anemia and palate aggregation cannot be avoided because of the wide presentation of CD47 on erythrocytes. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the regulation and function of CD47, and provides a new perspective for immunotherapy targeting CD47. It also highlights the clinical progress of targeting CD47 and discusses challenges and potential strategies. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of targeting CD47 in cancer immunotherapy, it also augments the concept of combination immunotherapy strategies by employing both innate and adaptive immune responses.",

These fields investigate how physical factors induced by cell adhesion and collective behaviors can directly regulate biologic processes, such as organ development and disease progression. Cell mechanics and mechanobiology thus make exciting biophysics education topics to illustrate how fundamental physics principles play a role in regulating cell biology. However, the field currently lacks hands-on activities that engage students in learning science and outreach programs in these topics. One such area is the development of robust hands-on modules that allow students to observe features of cell shape and mechanics and connect them to fundamental physics principles. Here, we demonstrate a workflow that engages students in studying epithelial cell mechanics by using commercial histology slides of frog skin. We show that by using recently developed artificial intelligence-based image-segmentation tools, students can easily quantify different cell morphologic features in a high-throughput manner. Using our workflow, students can reproduce 2 essential findings in cell mechanics: the common gamma distribution of normalized cell aspect ratio in jammed epithelia and the constant ratio between the nuclear and cellular area. Importantly, because the only required instrument for this active learning module is a readily available light microscope and a computer, our module is relatively low cost, as well as portable. These features make the module scalable for students at various education levels and outreach programs. This highly accessible education module provides a fun and engaging way to introduce students to the world of epithelial tissue mechanics.",

Participants completed measures of early adversity, EA, and current emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anxiety, somatization, positive/negative affect). Bayesian analyses found the most evidence for models with an interaction between sex and early adversity in predicting emotional functioning - revealing the expected negative relationship between early adversity and EA in females, but a positive relationship in males. Early adversity, but not EA, was associated with depression, anxiety, and implicit negative affect. Only explicit positive affect was associated with both early adversity and EA, and EA partially mediated the negative association between early adversity and positive affect.

SURECAN is a multi-centre, pragmatic, individual participant randomised controlled trial of an intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy supplemented by support for return to meaningful work and/or physical activity (ACT+). This qualitative study addresses the ways in which participants believe they benefit from ACT+ (or not), and how the ACT+ intervention might best be implemented into routine National Health Service (NHS) care. The study investigates experiences of ACT+ by different participants to understand how we can optimise the ACT+ intervention and its delivery (assuming the intervention is successful). We will conduct individual interviews with participants who have taken part in the active arm of the SURECAN trial to understand their experiences of engaging with and receiving ACT+, their perceptions of the impact of the therapy, and relevant contextual factors influencing these experiences. In particular, we will focus on comparing our interview findings between those trial participants who improved and those who failed to improve (or worsened), in terms of quality of life following ACT+. Additionally, we will conduct individual interviews with therapists who have delivered ACT+ as part of the SURECAN trial, to understand their experiences of delivering ACT+. Consistent with other qualitative protocols, this protocol is not registered. Instead, it is shared as a means of documenting ahead of time, how we are endeavouring to understand the ways in which a newly trialled talking therapy is received by patients and therapists, and how (if successful) it might be incorporated into the NHS.",

An understanding of the early molecular processes that lead to ESCC may facilitate opportunities for early diagnosis; however, these remain poorly defined. Tylosis with esophageal cancer (TOC) is a rare syndrome associated with a high lifetime risk of ESCC and germline mutations in RHBDF2, encoding iRhom2. Using TOC as a model of ESCC predisposition, this study aimed to identify early-stage transcriptional changes in ESCC development. Esophageal biopsies were obtained from control and TOC individuals, the latter undergoing surveillance endoscopy, and adjacent diagnostic biopsies were graded as having no dysplasia or malignancy. Bulk RNA-Seq was performed, and findings were compared with sporadic ESCC vs normal RNA-Seq datasets. Multiple transcriptional changes were identified in TOC samples, relative to controls, and many were detected in ESCC. Accordingly, pathway analyses predicted an enrichment of cancer-associated processes linked to cellular proliferation and metastasis, and several transcription factors were predicted to be associated with TOC and ESCC, including negative enrichment of GRHL2. Subsequently, a filtering strategy revealed 22 genes that were significantly dysregulated in both TOC and ESCC. Moreover, Keratin 17, which was upregulated in TOC and ESCC, was also found to be overexpressed at the protein level in 'normal' TOC esophagus tissue. Transcriptional changes occur in TOC esophagus prior to the onset of dysplasia, many of which are associated with ESCC. These findings support the utility of TOC to help reveal the early molecular processes that lead to sporadic ESCC.",

The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway presents as one of the most upregulated pathways in HCC. However, it has so far not been targetable in the clinical setting. Therefore, studying new targets of this signaling cascade from a therapeutic aspect could enable reversal, delay, or prevention of hepatocarcinogenesis. Although enormous advancement has been achieved in HCC research and its therapeutic management, since HCC often occurs in the context of other liver diseases such as cirrhosis leading to liver dysfunction and/or impaired drug metabolism, the current therapies face the challenge of safely and effectively delivering drugs to the HCC tumor site. In this review, we discuss how a targeted nano drug delivery system could help minimize the off-target toxicities of conventional HCC therapies as well as enhance treatment efficacy. We also put forward the current challenges in HCC nanomedicine along with some potential therapeutic targets from the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway that could be used for HCC therapy. Overall, this review will provide an insight to the current advances, limitations and how HCC nanomedicine could change the landscape of some of the undruggable targets in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.",

A PRS was constructed from 136 prespecified CRC-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the PRS for associations with AN prevalence at baseline screening colonoscopy or incident AN in participants with at least one follow-up colonoscopy. The PRS was associated with AN risk at baseline screening colonoscopy (P\u00a0= .004).

Recently, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released data from deep sequencing of environmental samples collected from the market after it was closed on 1 January 2020. Prior to this release, Crits-Christoph et\u00a0al. analyzed data from a subset of the samples. Both that study and the Chinese CDC study concurred that the samples contained genetic material from a variety of species, including some like raccoon dogs that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. However, neither study systematically analyzed the relationship between the amount of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 and different animal species. Here I implement a fully reproducible computational pipeline that jointly analyzes the number of reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 and the mitochondrial genomes of chordate species across the full set of samples. I validate the presence of genetic material from numerous species and calculate mammalian mitochondrial compositions similar to those reported by Crits-Christoph et\u00a0al. However, the SARS-CoV-2 content of the environmental samples is generally very low: only 21 of 176 samples contain more than ten SARS-CoV-2 reads, despite most samples being sequenced to depths exceeding 108 total reads. None of the samples with double-digit numbers of SARS-CoV-2 reads have a substantial fraction of their mitochondrial material from any non-human susceptible species. Only one of the fourteen samples with at least a fifth of the chordate mitochondrial material from raccoon dogs contains any SARS-CoV-2 reads, and that sample only has 1 of ~200,000,000 reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 reads are most correlated with reads mapping to various fish, such as catfish and largemouth bass. These results suggest that while metagenomic analysis of the environmental samples is useful for identifying animals or animal products sold at the market, co-mingling of animal and viral genetic material is unlikely to reliably indicate whether any animals were infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

Here we report a convergent synthesis of nimbolide through a late-stage coupling strategy. Through a sulfonyl hydrazone-mediated etherification and a radical cyclization, this strategy uses a pharmacophore-containing building block and diversifiable hydrazone units to enable the modular synthesis of nimbolide and its analogues. The broad generality of our synthetic strategy allowed access to a variety of analogues with their preliminary cellular cytotoxicity and PARP1 trapping activity reported.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 are members of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinases (NTRK) family, which encode TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors, respectively. Hematologic cancers are also linked to point mutations in the NTRK gene's kinase domain. Trk fusions are the most common genetic change associated with oncogenic activity in Trk-driven liquid tumors. Thus, point mutations in NTRK genes may also play a role in tumorigenesis. The structural and functional effect of mutations in Trk-B & Trk-C proteins remains unclear. Methods: In this research, Homology (threading-based approach) modeling and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations approaches are applied to examine the structural and functional behavior of native and mutant Trk-B and Trk-C proteins at the molecular level. Results: The result of this study reveals how the mutations in Trk-B (A203T & R458G) and Trk-C (E176D & L449F) proteins lost their stability and native conformations. The Trk-B mutant A203T became more flexible than the native protein, whereas the R458G mutation became more rigid than the native conformation of the Trk-B protein. Also, the Trk-C mutations (E176D & L449F) become more rigid compared to the native structure. Conclusions: This structural transition may interrupt the function of Trk-B and Trk-C proteins. Observing the impact of NTRK-2/3 gene alterations at the atomic level could aid in discovering a viable treatment for Trk-related leukemias.",

        "AbstractText": "The increasing incidence and prevalence of breast malignancies have led to increasing numbers of surgical interventions performed on the axilla and breast, including axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and mastectomy. The risk of postoperative complications, like breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL), can have significant deleterious cosmetic and quality of life effects. National guidelines and cancer councils publish recommendations to avoid skin puncturing procedures, such as venepuncture and intravenous (IV) cannulation, on arms ipsilateral to the surgical site to prevent BCRL occurrence. The initial trials that established a link between BCRL and skin puncture were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s; the evolution of surgical management of breast cancer has likely led to large decreases in complication rates. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, four databases were systematically searched for relevant articles. Eleven relevant articles were identified for inclusion in the final analysis. Updated Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists & Faculty of Pain Medicine (ANZCA) guidelines were included in the analysis following their publication after the initial search had been completed. The overall quality and quantity of evidence in this field is sufficient to conclude that skin puncturing procedures on ipsilateral arms should not be avoided in patients with previous breast or axillary surgery. The highest-quality and most recent available evidence does not support an association between BCRL and skin puncturing procedures. Policies and practices that advocate avoiding skin puncture procedures to prevent BCRL may lead to delays in clinical care. The 2023 ANZCA guidelines recommend against avoiding affected arms for peripheral access and suggest the removal of institutional policies preventing this practice. In patients that have undergone breast surgery or axillary procedures, venous access procedures can be safely performed on the ipsilateral arm. The evidence does not support overarching restrictions on using the ipsilateral arm without pre-existing lymphoedema.",

        "AbstractText": "There is a growing demand for lung parenchymal-sparing localized therapies due to the rising incidence of multifocal lung cancers and the growing number of patients who cannot undergo surgery. Lung cancer screening has led to the discovery of more pre-malignant or early-stage lung cancers, and the focus has shifted from treatment to prevention. Transbronchial therapy is an important tool in the local treatment of lung cancers, with microwave ablation showing promise based on early and mid-term results. To improve the precision and efficiency of transbronchial ablation, adjuncts such as mobile C-arm platforms, software to correct for computed tomography (CT)-to-body divergence, metal-containing nanoparticles, and robotic bronchoscopy are useful. Other forms of energy such as steam vapor therapy, pulsed electric field, and photodynamic therapy are being intensively investigated. In addition, the future of transbronchial therapies may involve the intratumoral injection of novel agents such as immunomodulating agents, gene therapies, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Extensive pre-clinical and some clinical research has shown the synergistic abscopal effect of combination of these agents with ablation. This article aims to provide the latest updates on these technologies and explore their most likely future applications.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy of highly proliferative lymphoblasts. ALL is the most common cancer in children, and is typically treated with combination chemotherapy. The 5-year survival of ALL improved significantly in recent decades with this treatment approach. However, certain age groups (below 2 and over 10 years of age) have much worse prognosis, and over 50% of patients with ALL experience long-term side effects proportional to the dosage of anticancer drugs. Therefore, different treatment strategies are required to improve survival in ALL and to reduce side effects of chemotherapy. Since epigenetic modifications are dominantly reversible, \"epidrugs\" (drugs targeting epigenetic markers) are considered for feasibility in the treatment of ALL as epigenetic modifications, and acetylation of histones was demonstrated to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALL. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to be differentially expressed in several hematological malignancies, including ALL. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) have been shown to express selective toxicity for ALL cells, but they showed limited efficacy and higher than expected toxicity in mouse models or clinical trials in ALL. The aim of this review is to examine the role of the microbiota and microbial metabolites in the mechanisms of HDAC functions, and explore the utilization of the microbiota and microbial metabolites in improving the efficacy of HDACi in ALL. HDAC regulators and natural HDACi are depleted in ALL due to microbiota change leading to a decrease in butyrate and propionate, and HDACi treatment is not effective in ALL due to their short half-life. We propose that HDACi released by the microbiota may be necessary in HDAC regulation and this process is impaired in ALL. Furthermore, the review will also consider the role of restoration of the microbiota or supplementation of natural HDACi in potentially restoring HDAC and HDACi functions.",

One of the treatment options is the combination of everolimus with exemestane or other endocrine drug in later lines mainly based on progression-free survival (PFS) results of the phase 3 BOLERO-2 trial. Altogether, clinical trials did not prove an overall survival (OS) benefit and considerable side effects hampered its application in the day-by-day practice. In recent years CDK4/6-inhibitors became a first-choice combination partner to the endocrine treatment, everolimus still has a place within the treatment armamentarium. Although everolimus is a targeted drug, there is no accepted predictive biomarker and further patient selection is not possible. However, several directions can be defined how to optimally use everolimus. For update information on everolimus treatment in breast cancer I have performed a literature search.

        "AbstractText": "Serous endometrial cancers (ECs) are an aggressive histotype of ECs which are disproportionately responsible for 40% of cancer-specific mortality rates despite constituting only 5-10% of all uterine cancers in incidence. In recent times, it has become increasingly evident that about 20-40% of uterine serous cancers (USCs) have molecular alterations in ERBB2 pathway with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) amplification or overexpression. We summarise the evidence on genetic and molecular alterations in HER2/neu pathway in USC with a focus on testing criteria, targeting agents and resistance mechanisms. We conducted a database search of PubMed/Medline up to 28th February 2023 for articles published in the English language using pre-defined search terms. One hundred and seventy-one relevant articles were subsequently reviewed for eligibility and inclusion in the review. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification is a significant development in the molecular profiling of ECs with a positive impact on the treatment of these tumors including USCs. Testing criteria for HER2/neu in USC with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has evolved in more than a decade with progress made towards EC specific testing guidelines. The findings of a recent phase III study have led to the development of practice changing guidelines towards improving patient outcomes. Molecular aberration in the HER2/neu pathway contributes to the aggressive behaviour of USC. Considering the clinical benefit conferred by HER2/neu targeted therapy, HER2/neu testing is recommended for all cases of serous EC in advanced and recurrent settings. Trastuzumab in combination with platinum and taxanes based chemotherapy is the recommended treatment option for patients with advanced or recurrent serous cancers who test positive to HER2/neu. Clinical trials on targeted therapy are ongoing and future research should focus on selection of patients who will derive the most benefit from such therapy.",

Herein, 188 patients (107 male; 81 female) who underwent radical surgery for OSCC were included. We evaluated the risk factors for postoperative CKD after treatment, including demographic, perioperative, and postoperative factors by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were divided into post-operative CKD and control groups based on eGFR evaluation. Overall survival (OS) rates were compared between the groups. eGFR decreased over time after treatment in both patient groups. Postoperative CKD was diagnosed in 56 (29.8%) patients. The average number of contrast-enhanced CT examinations was not an independent risk factor for postoperative CKD. However, lower hemoglobin on hospital discharge [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20090.53], lower eGFR on hospital discharge (OR\u2009=\u20090.84), and common use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR\u2009=\u200948.79) were significant risk factors associated with postoperative CKD. The control group was associated with a better OS than the postoperative CKD group; however, this difference was not significant.

However, until now, this pathway has not been thoroughly investigated in breast cancer. This study seeks to explore the influence of immunohistochemical expression and the correlation among RCC2, Rac1, and p53 in breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). Immunostaining was performed on 120 breast IDC specimens using RCC2, Rac1, and p53 antibodies. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the correlations between these antibodies. A Positive expression of RCC2, Rac1, and p53 was observed in 116 (96.7%), 120 (100%), and 33 (27.5%) of the breast cancer cases, respectively. RCC2, Rac1, and p53 demonstrated association with poor prognostic parameters such as frequent mitoses, high Ki-67 status, positive lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and advanced tumor stage. A highly significant direct correlation was found between each immunohistochemical marker and the other two markers. Shorter overall survival was linked to multifocal tumors (P=0.017), advanced tumor stage (T3) (P=0.010), Luminal B subtype (P=0.015), progressive disease (P=0.003), positive Her2neu status (P=0.008), and metastasis to distant organs (P<0.001). However, RCC2, Rac1, and p53 did not exhibit a significant association with overall survival. The high expression levels of RCC2, Rac1, and p53 in breast IDC suggest their potential role in tumor behavior. The association of RCC2 and Rac1 with poor prognostic parameters may serve as predictive indicators for aggressive tumors, thus implying that targeted therapy could be beneficial in the treatment of breast cancer.",

Multivariate analysis identified mild irAEs (hazard ratio [HR], 0.353; p = 0.010), ALBI grade 1 (HR, 0.389; p = 0.006), Child-Pugh class A (HR, 0.338; p = 0.002), and the absence of PVTT (HR, 0.556; p = 0.043) as independent predictors of better OS. Our study highlights the significant impact of irAE severity on the outcomes of patients with HCC receiving A + B. Notably, the occurrence of mild irAEs was independently associated with favourable survival, suggesting their potential role as surrogate indicators of HCC prognosis.",

        "AbstractText": "We aimed to characterize the initial healthcare journey of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) patients in Portugal, including healthcare provision and factors affecting therapeutic decisions, namely BRCA mutations testing. This is a descriptive cross-sectional, web-based survey using a convenience sampling approach. Portuguese oncologists and pathologists that routinely work with mPDAC patients from the different geographical regions and settings were invited to participate in the study via email (December 2020). Descriptive statistical analyses were performed, with categorical variables reported as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables with non-normal distribution as median and interquartile range (IQR) (Stata v.15.0). Seventy physicians participated in the study (43 oncologists, 27 pathologists). According to the responses, a median of 28 patients per center (IQR 12-70) was diagnosed with PDAC in the previous year; 22 of them referring (IQR 8-70) to mPDAC. The pointed median time from patients' first hospital admission until disease diagnosis/staging is between 2 and 4 weeks. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle biopsy is available in most hospitals (86%). Around 50% of physicians request BRCA testing; the assessment of additional biomarkers besides BRCA is requested by 40% of professionals. Half of them stated that BRCA testing should be requested earlier-upon histological diagnosis, especially because the median time for results is of 4.0 weeks (IQR 4-8). PARP inhibitors such as olaparib, when available, would be the therapy of choice for most oncologists (71%) if no disease' progression occurs after 4 months. Treatments' selection is usually grounded on clinical criteria (e.g., performance status, liver function). Around 45% of patients use FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX as the first-line therapy. Gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel is used by 35% of patients as the second-line therapy. Physicians in Portugal support the increasing role of patient-tailored treatments in mPDAC, whose selection should be grounded on tumoral subtyping and molecular profiling. Further efforts to develop multidisciplinary teams, standardized clinical practice, and optimize the implementation of new target therapies are needed.",

        "AbstractText": "Drug resistance presents a significant challenge to achieving positive clinical outcomes in anti-tumor therapy. Prior research has illuminated reasons behind drug resistance, including increased drug efflux, alterations in drug targets, and abnormal activation of oncogenic pathways. However, there's a need for deeper investigation into the impact of drug-resistant cells on parental tumor cells and intricate crosstalk between tumor cells and the malignant tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies on extracellular vesicles (EVs) have provided valuable insights. EVs are membrane-bound particles secreted by all cells, mediating cell-to-cell communication. They contain functional cargoes like DNA, RNA, lipids, proteins, and metabolites from mother cells, delivered to other cells. Notably, EVs are increasingly recognized as regulators in the resistance to anti-cancer drugs. This review aims to summarize the mechanisms of EV-mediated anti-tumor drug resistance, covering therapeutic approaches like chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and even radiotherapy. Detecting EV-based biomarkers to predict drug resistance assists in bypassing anti-tumor drug resistance. Additionally, targeted inhibition of EV biogenesis and secretion emerges as a promising approach to counter drug resistance. We highlight the importance of conducting in-depth mechanistic research on EVs, their cargoes, and functional approaches specifically focusing on EV subpopulations. These efforts will significantly advance the development of strategies to overcome drug resistance in anti-tumor therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a significant role in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Rapamycin is a potential therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies due to its ability to suppress mTOR activity. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in T-ALL pathophysiology and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of rapamycin and miRNAs in inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in T-ALL cells. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to find miRNAs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Twenty-five bone marrow samples were collected from T-ALL patients, alongside five control bone marrow samples from non-leukemia patients. The Jurkat cell line was chosen as a representative model for T-ALL. Gene and miRNA expression levels were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Two miRNAs exhibiting down-regulation in both clinical samples and Jurkat cells were transfected to the Jurkat cell line to investigate their impact on target gene expression. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential of combination therapy involving miRNAs and rapamycin, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were carried out. Six miRNAs (miR-3143, miR-3182, miR-99a/100, miR-155, miR-576-5p, and miR-501- 3p) were predicted as inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The expression analysis of both clinical samples and the Jurkat cell line revealed a simultaneous downregulation of miR-3143 and miR-3182. Transfection investigation demonstrated that the exogenous overexpression of miR-3143 and miR-3182 can effectively inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the Jurkat cell line. Moreover, when used as a dual inhibitor along with rapamycin, miR-3143 and miR-3182 significantly increased apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in the Jurkat cell line. These preliminary results highlight the potential for improving T-ALL treatment through multi-targeted therapeutic strategies involving rapamycin and miR-3143/miR-3182.",

        "AbstractText": "High metastasis, resistance to common treatments, and high mortality rate, has made triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to be the most invasive type of breast cancer. High telomerase activity and mitochondrial biogenesis are involved in breast cancer tumorigenesis. The catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), plays a role in telomere lengthening and extra-biological functions such as gene expression, mitochondria function, and apoptosis. In this study, it has been aimed to evaluate intrinsic-, extrinsic-apoptosis and DNMT3a and TET2 expression following the inhibition of telomerase and mitochondria respiration in TNBC cell lines. TNBC cells were treated with IC50 levels of BIBR1532, tigecycline, and also their combination. Then, telomere length, and DNMT3a, TET2, and hTERT expression were evaluated. Finally, apoptosis rate, apoptosis-related proteins, and genes were analyzed. The present results showed that IC50 level of telomerase and inhibition of mitochondria respiration induced apoptosis but did not leave any significant effect on telomere length. The results also indicated that telomerase inhibition induced extrinsic-apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and caused intrinsic- apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, it was found that the expression of p53 decreased and was ineffective in cell apoptosis. The expressions of DNMT3a and TET2 increased in cells. In addition, combination treatment was better than BIBR1532 and tigecycline alone. The inhibition of telomerase and mitochondria respiration caused intrinsic- and extrinsic- apoptosis and increased DNMT3a and TET2 expression and it could be utilized in breast cancer treatment.",

These compounds exhibit diverse biological effects, particularly showing promise as anticancer agents, including actions that inhibit CDK4/6. We designed and synthesized a range of substituted thiazolo-pyridopyrimidines (4a-p). Computational ADME/T analysis and molecular docking were performed using the crystal structure of CDK4/6. Subsequently, we synthesized the top-scoring compounds, characterized them using IR, NMR, and Mass spectroscopy, and assessed their impact on MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines using the SRB assay. To further evaluate stability, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for the two most promising compounds within the binding site. The docking scores indicated stronger interactions for compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, and 4g. As a result, these specific compounds (4a, 4c, 4d, and 4g) were chosen for synthesis and subsequent screening to assess their cytotoxic effects. Remarkably, compounds 4c and 4a exhibited the most promising activity in terms of their IC50 values across both tested cell lines. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation studies uncovered an elevated level of stability within the 4c-6OQO complex. By integrating insights from computational, in vitro, and molecular dynamics simulation findings, compound 4c emerges as a leading candidate for future investigations. The presence of a polar hydroxyl group at the C2 position of the 8-phenyl substitution on the pyridopyrimidine rings appears to contribute to the heightened activity of the compound. Further enhancements to cytotoxic potential could be achieved through structural refinements.",

Although the potential benefits of the synergetic use of sweeteners have been known for many years, recent development based on synthesis strategies to produce sucrose-like taste profiles is emerging where biocatalyst approaches may be preferred to produce and supply specific sweetener compounds. From a nutritional standpoint, high-intensity sweeteners have fewer calories than sugars while providing a major sweet potency, placing them in the spotlight as valuable alternatives to sugar. Due to the modern world awareness and incidence of metabolic diseases, both food research and growing markets have focused on two generally regarded as safe (GRAS) groups of compounds: the sweet diterpenoid glycosides present on the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana and, more recently, on the cucurbitane triterpene glycosides present on the fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii.

Robust evidence to guide treatment is lacking and knowledge on targeted therapies and immunotherapy is mainly based on adult studies. Currently, the International Society of Pediatric Oncology-Renal Tumor Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) 2016 UMBRELLA protocol recommends sunitinib for metastatic or unresectable RCC. This retrospective study describes the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-(L)1) monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapeutic regimens in advanced-stage and relapsed pediatric RCC. Of the 31 identified patients (0-18\u2009years) with histologically proven RCC, 3/31 presented with TNM stage I/II, 8/31 with TNM stage III, and 20/31 with TNM stage IV at diagnosis. The majority were diagnosed with translocation type RCC (MiT-RCC) (21/31) and the remaining patients mainly presented with papillary or clear-cell RCC. Treatment in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, or upon relapse or progression, included mono- or combination therapy with a large variety of drugs, illustrating center specific choices in most patients. Sunitinib was often administered as first choice and predominantly resulted in stable disease (53%). Other frequently used drugs included axitinib, cabozantinib, sorafenib, and nivolumab; however, no treatment seemed more promising than sunitinib. Overall, 15/31 patients died of disease, 12/31 are alive with active disease, and only four patients had a complete response. The sample size and heterogeneity of this cohort only allowed descriptive statistical analysis.

For instance, childhood cancer survivors treated with chest radiation and/or anthracycline are often at risk of developing cardiotoxicity during their adulthood. Often the primary focus of a study could be on estimating the cumulative incidence of a particular outcome of interest such as cardiotoxicity. However, it is challenging to evaluate patients continuously and usually, this information is collected through cross-sectional surveys by following patients longitudinally. This leads to interval-censored data since the exact time of the onset of the toxicity is unknown. Rai et al. computed the transition intensity rate using a parametric model and estimated parameters using maximum likelihood approach in an illness-death model. However, such approach may not be suitable if the underlying parametric assumptions do not hold. This manuscript proposes a semi-parametric model, with a logit relationship for the treatment intensities in two groups, to estimate the transition intensity rates within the context of an illness-death model. The estimation of the parameters is done using an EM algorithm with profile likelihood.

This study aims to describe the clinical experience of patients treated with brentuximab-vedotin through expanded access modality. A retrospective study on clinical information of patients diagnosed with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with brentuximab-vedotin at the Regional Hospital of Concepci\u00f3n in the period 2015-2021. 7 patients were identified, 5/7 male, with a median age of 35 years (21-50). Five cases were mixed cellularity, and two were nodular sclerosis. Four were in stage II, 1/7 in stage III, and 3/7 in stage IV. The median number of previous treatment lines was 4 (3-5), and the relapse was post-transplantation in two cases. In 6/7 cases, brentuximab-vedotin was used as induction, and in one case, it was used as post-autologous bone marrow transplant maintenance. The administration was outpatient via a peripheral route with a median dose of 150 mg and ten cycles. In one case, dose adjustment was required due to toxicity. Three out of 6 patients achieved complete remission and underwent autologous stem cell transplantation. brentuximab-vedotin is an outpatient medication with low toxicity that can optimize the treatment of patients with relapsed-refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma.",

The current guidelines recommends that diagnosis requires the finding of intestinal metaplasia (IM) with goblet cells of at least 1 cm in length. BE affects approximately 1% of the general population and up to 14% of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). BE is a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which has increased in western countries. The main risk factors described for EAC associated with BE are male sex, age > 50 years, central obesity and tobacco use. Annual risk of EAC in patients with BE without dysplasia, low grade (LGD) and high-grade dysplasia is 0,1-0,3%, 0,5% y 5-8%, respectively. Treatment of non-dysplastic BE consists mainly of a healthy lifestyle change, chemoprevention with proton pump inhibitors and surveillance endoscopy every 3 to 5 years. It is recommended that from the presence of LGD patients are referred to an expert center for confirmation of the diagnosis, stage and thus define their management. In patients with BE and dysplasia or early-stage cancer, endoscopic therapy with resection and ablation is successful in about 90% of the patients. The main adverse event is esophageal stricture, which is managed endoscopically.",

In this study we created disease estimates using national EHR for three high burden conditions, compared estimates between linked and unlinked datasets and produced stratified estimates by age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and geographical region. EHRs containing primary care (Clinical Practice Research Datalink), secondary care (Hospital Episode Statistics) and mortality records (Office for National Statistics) were used. We used existing disease phenotyping algorithms to identify cases of cancer (breast, lung, colorectal and prostate), type 1 and 2 diabetes, and lower back pain. We calculated age-standardised incidence of first cancer, point prevalence for diabetes, and primary care consultation prevalence for low back pain. 7.2 million people contributing 45.3 million person-years of active follow-up between 2000-2014 were included. CPRD-HES combined and CPRD-HES-ONS combined lung and bowel cancer incidence estimates by sex were similar to cancer registry estimates. Linked CPRD-HES estimates for combined Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes were consistently higher than those of CPRD alone, with the difference steadily increasing over time from 0.26% (2.99% for CPRD-HES vs. 2.73 for CPRD) in 2002 to 0.58% (6.17% vs. 5.59) in 2013. Low back pain prevalence was highest in the most deprived quintile and when compared to the least deprived quintile the difference in prevalence increased over time between 2000 and 2013, with the largest difference of 27% (558.70 per 10,000 people vs 438.20) in 2013. We use national EHRs to produce estimates of burden of disease to produce detailed estimates by deprivation, ethnicity and geographical region. National EHRs have the potential to improve disease burden estimates at a local and global level and may serve as more automated, timely and precise inputs for policy making and global burden of disease estimation.",

        "AbstractText": "Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is an ultra-rare cancer that makes up less than 3% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It most often arises in the soft tissues of the proximal limbs and has a higher incidence in males. Though EMC has a good prognosis, it has an indolent course with high rates of local recurrence as well as metastasis to the lungs. EMC is characterized in 70% of cases by an EWS1-NR4A3 translocation, leading to constitutive expression of NR4A3. Structural variants (SVs) in EMC, especially large-scale genomic alterations, have not been well studied and studies are severely limited by sample size. In this study, we describe Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of a rare case of matched EMC primary tumor, lung metastasis, and pelvic metastasis to identify genomic alterations. We examined somatic variants, copy number variants (CNVs), and larger scale SVs such as translocations and breakend points. While the primary tumor and lung metastasis had similar somatic variations and CNVs, the pelvic metastasis had more unique SVs with especially increased mutational burden of SVs in chromosome 2. This suggests that different molecular drivers appear in more advanced, relapsing EMC compared with the primary tumor and early lung metastasis. Genomic studies such as ours may identify novel molecular complexities in rare cancers that may be leveraged for therapeutic strategies and precision medicine.",

CAR-T cell therapy was approved in 2018 as the first Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) for treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. ATMPs are cell- and gene-based therapies that show great promise for treating various cancers and hereditary diseases. While some new ATMPs have been approved, ongoing clinical trials are expected to lead to the approval of many more. However, the production of CAR-T cells presents a significant challenge due to the high costs associated with the manufacturing process, making the therapy very expensive (approx. $400,000). Furthermore, autologous CAR-T therapy is limited to a make-to-order approach, which makes scaling economical production difficult. First attempts are being made to automate this multi-step manufacturing process, which will not only directly reduce the high manufacturing costs but will also enable comprehensive data collection. AI technologies have the ability to analyze this data and convert it into knowledge and insights. In order to exploit these opportunities, this paper analyses the data potential in the automated CAR-T production process and creates a mapping to the capabilities of AI applications.

However, the relationships among meridian energy during lung cancer surgery, changes in quality of life, and prognosis have not been investigated. This study was designed to explore the associations among meridian energy, changes in quality of life, and prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer undergoing surgery. A longitudinal, repeated-measures design was used. Basic data forms, meridian energy measurements, and a concise 12-item health status questionnaire were administered to the participants at the time of diagnosis, 2 weeks post-surgery, and 12 weeks post-surgery. During this period, changes were analyzed, and their association with postoperative risks was explored. Forty-eight cases were investigated. Both meridian energy and quality of life were found to be significantly decreased 2 weeks after surgery. The high/low ratio of meridian energy, the physical component score of the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey Questionnaire, gender, cancer stage, and body mass index were identified as significantly associated with prognosis. Conclusion/Implications for Practice: The declining trends in meridian energy and quality of life during the 2 weeks after surgery in patients with lung cancer are associated with poor postoperative prognoses.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a devastating complication of cancer that can significantly impact a patient's health and life. The incidence of CAT is approximately 20%, and 1 in 5 cancer patients will develop CAT annually. Indeed, CAT can promote pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, leading to increased morbidity and mortality that dramatically impact survival. CAT can also provoke delay or discontinuation of anticancer treatment, which may result in a lack of treatment efficacy and high costs for patients, institutions, and society. Current guidelines advocate direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as the first-line anticoagulant option in CAT. Compared to low-molecular-weight-heparins (LMWHs), DOACs are advantageous in that they typically have an oral route of administration, do not require laboratory monitoring, and have a more predictable anticoagulant effect. However, in patients with thrombocytopenia, renal failure, or those receiving anticancer regimens with potential for drug-drug interactions, LMWH is still the mainstay of care. The main limitation of current anticoagulant agents is related to bleeding risk (BR), both for DOACs and LMWHs. Specifically, DOACs have been associated with high BR in gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers. In this challenging scenario, abelacimab, an anti-factor XI agent, could represent a viable option in the management of CAT due to its \"hemostasis sparing\" effect. The safe profile of abelacimab could be useful in patients with active malignancy and CAT, as long-term anticoagulant therapy is often required. Two ongoing international phase III trials (Aster and Magnolia) compare abelacimab with the standard of care (i.e., apixaban in patients with CAT and dalteparin in those with CAT and high BR, respectively). Abelacimab is a new and attractive anticoagulant for the management of CAT, especially in the insidious and critical scenario of active cancer patients with venous thromboembolism and high BR. The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the updated evidence on the performance of DOACs and LMWHs in the treatment of CAT and to focus on the potential role of abelacimab in CAT and its promising associated clinical trials.",

The ratio of serum globulin to albumin (GAR) has been used to predict the prognosis of patients with various cancers. It has been proven that GAR is related to the prognosis of patients with stroke. However, GAR's role in cardiovascular disease remains unclear. Our purpose was to investigate the predictive value of GAR on clinical outcomes in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). From Dec. 2016 to Oct. 2021, a total of 14,994 patients undergoing PCI patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were divided into high GAR group (GAR \u2265 0.76, n = 4087) and low GAR group (GAR < 0.76, n = 10,907). The incidence of adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular mortality (CM), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) was compared between the two groups. Multivariate Cox regression was used to adjust for the effects of confounding factors, while hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Median follow-up time was 24 months. Compared with the low GAR group, the high GAR group had significantly higher incidence of ACM (6.5% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001); CM (4.9% vs. 1.2%, p < 0.001), MACE (10.5% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.001), and MACCE (11.3% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed the patients in the high GAR group had a 1.62-fold increased risk for ACM (HR = 2.622, 95% CI: 2.130-3.228, p < 0.01), a 1.782-fold increased risk for CM (HR = 2.782, 95% CI: 2.180-3.550, p < 0.01). There was a 37.2% increased risk for MACE (HR = 1.372, 95% CI: 1.204-1.564, p < 0.01), and 32.4% increased risk for MACCE (HR = 1.324, 95% CI: 1.169-1.500, p < 0.01), compared to the patients in the low GAR group. The present study suggested that post-PCI CAD patients with higher GAR presented significantly increased mortality and adverse events GAR level at admission may 296 be considered as part of risk stratification when PCI is possible in patients with coronary heart disease.

Although personalized computational modeling has been used to understand VT and its treatment noninvasively, this approach can be computationally intensive and time consuming. Therefore, finding a balance between mesh size and computational efficiency is important. This study aimed to find an optimal mesh resolution that minimizes the need for computational resources while maintaining numerical accuracy and to investigate the effect of mesh resolution variation on the simulation results. We constructed ventricular models from contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data from six patients with MI. We created seven different models for each patient, with average edge lengths ranging from 315 to 645 \u00b5m using commercial software, Mimics. Programmed electrical stimulation was used to assess VT inducibility from 19 sites in each heart model. The simulation results in the slab model with adaptive tetrahedral mesh (same as in the patient-specific model) showed that the absolute and relative differences in conduction velocity (CV) were 6.1 cm/s and 7.8% between average mesh sizes of 142 and 600 \u00b5m, respectively. However, the simulation results in the six patient-specific models showed that average mesh sizes with 350 \u00b5m yielded over 85% accuracy for clinically relevant VT. Although average mesh sizes of 417 and 478 \u00b5m could also achieve approximately 80% accuracy for clinically relevant VT, the percentage of incorrectly predicted VTs increases. When conductivity was modified to match the CV in the model with the finest mesh size, the overall ratio of positively predicted VT increased. The proposed personalized heart model could achieve an optimal balance between simulation time and VT prediction accuracy when discretized with adaptive tetrahedral meshes with an average edge length about 350 \u00b5m.",

Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, crizotinib (40 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   for four weeks), and crizotinib + sacubitril/valsartan (40 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   /60 mg \u22c5 kg - 1   \u22c5 d - 1   for four weeks). Expression of genes in myocardial tissue were detected by transcriptomic sequencing, with verification of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Blood pressure (BP) and cardiac function of animals were measured using non-invasive monitoring and echocardiography approaches. Ventricular refractory period (RP), as well as the induction rate and score of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) were detected by in vivo electrophysiology. Epicardial conductance was measured by mapping. Expression of Myh7 in myocardium was detected by western blot and RT-PCR. DEGs detected using transcriptomic sequencing included 10 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated genes. The first 5 DEGs identified were Myh7, Ngp, Lcn2, Ciart and Ptgds. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) result indicated that Myh7 is involved in myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac muscle contraction. Crizotinib treatment increased blood pressure, prolonged QTc interval, shortened ventricular RP, increased the incidence and score of right VAs, and increased Myh7 expression. Most of these responses were limited by sacubitril/valsartan. Crizotinib induced a range of cardiotoxic side effects in a mouse model and increased Myh7 expression represents a biomarker for this response.

Patients with cancer were also associated with shorter mean number of days to composite CVD readmission (60.48 days vs 68.32 days, p < 0.001) and longer length of stay of composite CVD readmission (8.21 days vs 7.13 days, p < 0.001). These trends were maintained in analyses of the individual CVD. Hospitalized patients with cancer experienced higher rates of unplanned readmission due to CVD, and their CVD readmissions occurred sooner and required longer lengths of stay compared to patients without cancer. Efforts to reduce unplanned CVD readmissions, such as providing optimized chronic post-discharge care, may improve the health outcomes of patients with cancer.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Risk of Cardiovascular Events with Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) Inhibitors among Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.",
        "AbstractText": "Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors have shown promising survival outcomes with additional treatments to the traditional endocrine therapy (ET) in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR-positive) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative (HER2-negative) advanced breast cancer (aBC). However, the head-to-head cardiovascular safety profile of these three agents (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) remains unclear. We summarized the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and hypertension associated with the use of CDK4/6 inhibitor in randomized control trials (RCTs) and compared the risks of MACE and hypertension through network-meta analysis (NMA). A systematic search through PubMed and Cochrane Library was performed to identify phase III RCTs reporting cardiovascular safety data of CDK4/6 inhibitors in patients with aBC. We qualitatively synthesized the incidence of MACE and hypertension associated with CDK4/6 inhibitor use within on-treatment or placebo-controlled duration. A Bayesian NMA with random-effects models was performed, and pairwise comparisons between treatment options were presented by odds ratio (OR). The probability of each treatment arm's relative ranking was reported using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method. Nine RCTs with four unique treatment arms and event(s) in at least one arm were included in the NMA. A total of 5218 patients were analyzed for MACE outcomes. The overall incidence of MACE in the CDK4/6 inhibitors+ET arm was 0.8%, while the endocrine therapy alone group was 0.4%. Abemaciclib+ET ranked the best in reducing the risk of MACE (SUCRA = 0.90) as compared to ET alone (SUCRA = 0.67, OR = 0.45, 95% credible interval (CI) = 0.07-2.82), palbociclib+ET (SUCRA = 0.25, OR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.00-2.39) and ribociclib+ET (SUCRA = 0.17, OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.00-1.18). The findings were similar in the MH network. However, abemaciclib+ET (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81) had a significantly lower risk of MACE than ribociclib+ET in the MH network. No statistically significant differences in hypertension were shown among all comparisons. Abemaciclib+ET may have a lower risk of MACE for the treatment of aBC, while palbociclib+ET may reduce the risk of hypertension in this population. Our findings suggest a comparative cardiovascular safety trend among the three CDK4/6 inhibitors, but further research on direct comparisons is needed to guide treatment choice.",

        "AbstractText": "Abnormal glucose metabolism is present in most patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Inflammation is considered to be a common risk factor for CAD and diabetes. Fibrinogen-to-albumin ratio (FAR), a novel inflammation biomarker, has been proposed as a predictor for cardiovascular disease. However, the relationship between the level of FAR and long-term mortality including all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, remains unknown in CAD patients, especially those with prediabetes. We enrolled 66,761 CAD patients from 2007 to 2020 from a multi-center registry cohort study. The primary outcomes were the all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality. FAR was calculated using the following formula: Fibrinogen (g/L)/Albumin (g/L). Patients were divided into three groups by FAR tertile (low FAR (FAR-L), median FAR (FAR-M), high FAR (FAR-H)), and further categorized into 9 groups according to FAR and glucose metabolism status (normal glucose regulation (NGR), prediabetes mellitus (PreDM), diabetes mellitus (DM)). Cox regression models and competing risk models were used to examine the relationships between FAR and clinical outcomes. 66,761 patients (63.1 \u00b1 11.0 years, 75.3% male) were enrolled. During the follow-up, 10,534 patients died, including 4991 cardiovascular deaths and 1092 cancer deaths. After adjusting for confounders, higher FAR was associated with increased risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in CAD patients with NGR, PreDM and DM. The risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was highest in FAR-H with DM (HR (95% CI) = 1.71 (1.58-1.86), 2.11 (1.86-2.38), respectively; p < 0.001). FAR-H with PreDM was significantly associated with the highest risk of cancer mortality (HR (95% CI) = 2.27 (1.70-3.02), p < 0.001). Adding FAR to the original model significantly improved the prediction of long-term mortality. Increased FAR was significantly associated with higher risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in CAD patients with NGR, PreDM and DM. Abnormal glucose metabolism augments the relationship between FAR and mortality. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05050877.",

The topic of this paper is differential network analysis, which focuses on capturing the differences between two or more precision matrices. We discuss the connection between the thresholding method and the D-trace loss method on differential network analysis in the case that the precision matrices share the common connected components. Based on this connection, we further propose the cluster D-trace loss method which directly estimates the differential network and achieves model selection consistency. Simulation studies demonstrate its improved performance and computational efficiency.

        "AbstractText": "Diabetic neuropathy is a well-known complication of diabetes. Recently, hyperglycemia-induced toxicity has been confirmed to participates in multiple cellular pathways typical for neural deterioration. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase/pre-b cell colony-enhancing factor (Nampt/PBEF)/visfatin is a novel endogenous ligand that some studies have shown its neuroprotective effects on neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that visfatin may prevent high glucose (HG)-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting apoptosis, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) responses properly. In this study, pheochromocytoma cell line 12 (PC12) cells were exposed to both HG concentrations (50, 75, 100, 125, 150 mM) and visfatin (50, 100, 150 ng/mL) at different time -points to determine the optimum time and dose of glucose and visfatin. To investigate the effects of visfatin on HG-induced damage in the PC12 diabetic neuropathy model, we examined ROS response, apoptosis, and autophagy using ROS detection kit, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR/Western blot, respectively. We determined that HG concentration significantly increased the ROS level and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells. However, visfatin treatment significantly decreased the ROS production (P<0.05) and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells (P<0.0001). Beclin-1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level (P<0.05) and light chain 3 (Lc3)-II protein level (P<0.05) showed that the autophagy pathway is impaired by HG concentrations. We concluded that visfatin can sufficiently decrease neural damage caused by ROS production and apoptosis under HG-induced toxicity. High glucose significantly increased the ROS level and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells;The autophagy pathway is impaired by high glucose;Nampt/PBEF/visfatin can significantly reduce neural damage caused by ROS production and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cells. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a failure in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Visfatin (Nampt/PBEF) has insulin-mimetic effects. So far, no study has assessed its effects on diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, we examined the neuroprotective effects of visfatin on cell line 12 (PC12) against glucose-induced neurotoxicity. Based on the results, it was concluded that the Nampt/PBEF/visfatin can significantly reduce neural damage caused by production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis of diabetic PC12 cell.",

A rare cause of ACTH-dependent endogenous hypercorticism is ACTH-ectopic syndrome (ACTH-ES) (about 15-20% of cases). ACTH-ES is a syndrome of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hyperproduction by neuroendocrine tumors of extrahypophyseal origin.

        "AbstractText": "Pericardial effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. In nations with high tuberculosis (TB) load, TB is the most common cause of pericardial effusion. 1-2% of patients with pulmonary TB develop Pericardial TB worldwide. Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) TB, including extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases, are rising in number. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, which has certain immune functions in the body. ADA levels are increased in inflammatory conditions, like pleural, pericardial, or joint effusions, of bacterial etiology, granulomatous conditions, neoplasms, and autoimmune pathologies. TB is the only lymphocytosis involving disease with increased ADA levels. MDR EPTB is rare, but cases are on the rise, and tuberculous pericardial effusion is one such example. Hence, it is important to know the percentage of cases detected by a culture that can be identified by cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT), their resistance patterns, and to identify potential markers like ADA, which can help in early identification of cases. The objectives of this study were to identify the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacilli in culture, and correlate them with cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) results and their drug-resistance, in the Pericardial tubercular effusion, and to find if Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) levels can be used as a predictor of the presence of MTB in pericardial fluid. We enrolled 52 patients with moderate to large tuberculous pericardial effusion, based on pericardial fluid analysis, CBNAAT, and culture methods, between January 2021 and December 2021. The mean age of the patients was 41.85\u00a0+\u00a017.88 years, with a median of 38 years. Males made up 57.7% of the total patients. MTB was detected in 16 (30.8%) patients in the CBNAAT evaluations. 14 (87.5%) of the CBNAAT-positive TB patients were sensitive to Rifampicin, whereas the remaining 2 (12.5%) were resistant to Rifampicin on CBNAAT. MTB was found to be growing in 8 (15.38%) drug sensitivity test cultures. Out of these 8, 6 were sensitive to first-line drugs, whereas 2 were resistant to both Isoniazid and Rifampicin. The presence of cough was found to have a significant difference between CBNAAT-detected MTB positive and negative patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), whereas an insignificant difference was found for the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyspnea, or fever. There was also an insignificant difference between the number of patients positive for the Tuberculin skin test, between the two groups. ADA was significantly higher in the MTB-detected CBNAAT group (85.91\u00a0+\u00a037.60U/L vs 39.78\u00a0+\u00a024.31U/L, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), whereas the total leukocyte count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, random blood sugar levels, and serum protein levels had no significant difference. The area under the Receiver Operator Curve (CBNAAT positive: dependent variable; ADA: test result variable) was 0.854 (null hypothesis rejected), with a standard error of 0.078. Culture is the gold standard method to diagnose tuberculosis. Detection of MTB on pericardial fluid culture is very uncommon, though in our study, culture came out positive in 16% of patients, and 4% were resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid. Higher ADA levels in pericardial fluid are an indicator of tuberculous pericardial effusion.",

A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients enrolled under RNTCP (now NTEP) in New Delhi among 27 functional RNTCP districts. Around 200\u00a0TB patients who are enrolled in the Nikshay App and are also on treatment were considered. A structured questionnaire was prepared for the interview guide. Analysis was done using bivariate analysis, chi-square tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Among the total participants, 173 (86.5%) were adherent and the remaining 27 (13.5%) participants were non-adherent. The majority of the participants (91%) said they were able to follow the routine to the DOTS center, and 9% said they find it difficult to report to the DOTS center as per their schedule. Only 12.35% of non-adherent participants were seen among those who get regular reminders from their families to take medicines, as compared to 18.42% among those who did not get regular reminders from their families.

        "AbstractText": "Radiation therapy (RT) is a frontline approach to treating cancer. While the target of radiation dose delivery is the tumor, there is an inevitable spill of dose to nearby normal organs causing complications. This phenomenon is known as radiotherapy toxicity. To predict the outcome of the toxicity, statistical models can be built based on dosimetric variables received by the normal organ at risk (OAR), known as Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) models. To tackle the challenge of the high dimensionality of dosimetric variables and limited clinical sample sizes, statistical models with variable selection techniques are viable choices. However, existing variable selection techniques are data-driven and do not integrate medical domain knowledge into the model formulation. We propose a knowledge-constrained generalized linear model (KC-GLM). KC-GLM includes a new mathematical formulation to translate three pieces of domain knowledge into non-negativity, monotonicity, and adjacent similarity constraints on the model coefficients. We further propose an equivalent transformation of the KC-GLM formulation, which makes it possible to solve the model coefficients using existing optimization solvers. Furthermore, we compare KC-GLM and several well-known variable selection techniques via a simulation study and on two real datasets of prostate cancer and lung cancer, respectively. These experiments show that KC-GLM selects variables with better interpretability, avoids producing counter-intuitive and misleading results, and has better prediction accuracy.",

Quantitative measurements of circ-METTL15, miR-200c-3p, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in PTC cells were conducted using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis.

Patients and families face barriers to access trials, which are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to assess availability of early phase trials and examine the impact of distance from home to study centre on trial enrolment among paediatric oncology patients with RRPD. Oncology patients \u226418 years at diagnosis who later had RRPD were identified retrospectively via registry at the only quaternary paediatric oncology centre in British Columbia (BC). We determined if distance to home, as calculated using geocoding software, was predictive of trial offer or enrolment. Between January 2015 and July 2021, 266 patients experienced 396 RRPD events. Seventy-five patients (28.2%) were eligible for an early phase trial at least once. At first eligible event, 61 patients (22.9%) were offered trial (median age 11.8 years; 69.0% male; 46.0% with CNS tumour) and thirty patients (11.3%) enrolled.

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide and is a well-known cause for cancer mortality in females. COX-2 (cyclooxygenase) plays a vital role in development of some human cancers such as lung, colon and breast. It is a potent enzyme that is important for the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. These prostaglandins mediate cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis which contributes to carcinogenesis. Overexpression of COX-2 has been detected in several malignancies including breast cancer. COX-2 overexpression is regarded as a poor prognostic marker of breast cancer.The present study will aim to study the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 in breast cancer and compare it with known histopathological parameters thus assessing its prognostic value. This will be an observational study conducted in the Department of Pathology, JNMC, Wardha (Sawangi). Radical mastectomy specimens will be studied for COX-2 expression by immunohistochemistry in patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma. COX-2 expression will be quantified as immunohistochemical score and results will be correlated with various histopathological parameters. The expected result of our study will suggest an association of COX-2 expression to the factors associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. A positive correlation is expected between larger tumor size, positive lymph node status, higher T stage and N stage and lymphovascular invasion. Conclusions will be drawn from the obtained results of the immunohistochemical study by using COX-2- for detection of overexpression of COX-2 when evaluated with TNM staging, histological grading and molecular types of breast cancer.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a novel financial navigation pathway that leverages existing patient financial services and resources with corresponding patient-centered, community-informed strategies, via study participants, that may be utilized in routine care to reduce financial hardship among cancer patients. We conducted in-depth interviews (n=50) with 34 cancer patients and 16 cancer care professionals at a National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer center located in a dense urban area of the US between December2022 to June 2023. Content analyses resulted in emergent themes and representative quotations on experiences of financial hardship within the material, behavioral, and psychosocial domains. Investigators used emergent themes to develop financial strategies and construct a financial navigation pathway to screen patients for and intervene upon the financial toxicity of cancer in routine care. This study followed an innovative approach by constructing a financial navigation pathway tool that follows the oncological workflow at a National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer center.

Granulocyte harvest using conventional acid citrate dextrose (ACD) anticoagulant (ACD-A) by apheresis is not satisfactory in comparison to the use of hydroxyethyl starch (HES), but the latter is associated with various adverse events, especially with high-molecular-weight HES. This study aimed to assess the beneficial impact of the use of medium-molecular-weight (MMW)-HES and trisodium citrate combination over ACD-A in granulocyte apheresis when using Spectra Optia. This was a retrospective study comparing granulocyte harvest results with the use of ACD or HES and trisodium citrate combination. All the donors in both the groups received single 600 \u03bcg of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor subcutaneous injection followed by 8 mg of dexamethasone tablet 10-12 h and omnacortil 60 mg orally 3 h before harvest. A number of adverse incidents, if any, were observed and noted. Donor/procedure parameters were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test/unpaired t-test. Granulocyte yield (mean: 3.29 \u00d7 1010/unit vs. 4.5 \u00d7 1010/unit in the ACD and HES groups, respectively, P \u2264 0.0001) was significantly better in the HES group.

There was no significant adverse event noted in any of these two groups. In our study, granulocytes with optimum yield can be easily harvested with Spectra Optia cell separator using 6% HES (MMW) and trisodium citrate combination with standard 12-h interval gap between mobilization and harvest.

        "AbstractText": "Although poor oral health and several lifestyle factors have been found to be associated with cancer risk, their joint relationship has rarely been studied. We prospectively examined the associations of oral health and healthy lifestyle factors with cancer risk among 0.5 million rural and urban residents from the China Kadoorie Biobank (2004-2015). Oral health status was assessed from self-reported baseline questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle index comprising non-smoking, non-drinking, ideal body shape, physical activity and healthy diet was calculated for each participant, and categorized into favorable, intermediate and unfavorable lifestyle behavior. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) relating oral health and healthy lifestyle index to cancer risk using Cox proportional hazards models. We estimated the population attributable risk percent (PAR%) and 95% CIs using multivariate models. During a median follow-up of 9 years, 23,805 new cancer cases were documented, with 52% from rural areas and 48% from urban areas. Compared with those with good oral health and favorable lifestyle, participants with poor oral health and unfavorable lifestyle had a higher risk of developing cancer in both rural (adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.39-1.74]; P for trend < 0.001) and urban areas (adjusted HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.24-1.67]; P for trend < 0.001). A significant multiplicative interaction between oral health and healthy lifestyle index on cancer risk was found in rural residents (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.004) rather than in urban residents (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.973). Assuming poor oral health as an additional risk factor, the PAR% of total cancer increased by 3.0% and 1.1% for participants with intermediate lifestyle and unfavorable lifestyle, respectively. These findings suggest a joint effect of oral health and common lifestyle factors on cancer risk. Promotion of healthy lifestyle by integration of good oral health would be beneficial to consider in cancer prevention strategies.",

This research examined the predictive function of tumor burden-incorporated machine-learning algorithms for overall survival (OS) and their value in guiding treatment in patients with LA-NPC. Individuals with LA-NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Tumor burden signature-based OS prediction models were established using a nomogram and two machine-learning methods, the interpretable eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) risk prediction model, and DeepHit time-to-event neural network. The models' prediction performances were compared using the concordance index (C-index) and the area under the curve (AUC). The patients were divided into two cohorts based on the risk predictions of the most successful model. The efficacy of IC combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy was compared to that of chemoradiotherapy alone. The 1 221 eligible individuals, assigned to the training (n\u00a0=\u00a0813) or validation (n\u00a0=\u00a0408) set, showed significant respective differences in the C-indices of the XGBoost, DeepHit, and nomogram models (0.849 and 0.768, 0.811 and 0.767, 0.730 and 0.705).

IC presented survival benefits in the XGBoost-derived high-risk but not low-risk group. This research used machine-learning algorithms to create and verify a comprehensive model integrating tumor burden with clinical variables to predict OS and determine which patients will most likely gain from IC. This model could be valuable for delivering patient counseling and conducting clinical evaluations.",

In an oncogenic context, senescence is considered a tumor suppressive mechanism as it prevents cell proliferation and inhibits the progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease. However, recent studies have demonstrated that senescent tumor cells, which could spontaneously exist within cancer tissues or arise in response to various cancer interventions (the so-called therapy-induced senescence, TIS), can acquire pro-tumorigenic properties and are capable of driving local and metastatic relapse. This highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of cellular senescence in cancer biology. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the pathological function of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells and discuss possible mechanisms by which tumor cell senescence contributes to cancer relapse.

Proteomic profiles were obtained through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS-based DIA proteomics. Candidate plasma proteins were identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) combined with machine learning and further validated by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the biomarker panel. There was a clear distinction in proteomic features among CGC, CHGD, CLGD, and the healthy controls.

The resultant outcome, an augmentation of chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy, attests to the transformative potential of this concept. The study not only bequeaths novel insights and methodologies to surmount barriers in drug delivery for tumor treatment but also holds promise in elevating the precision, efficacy, and safety of tailored therapeutic regimens. Within this discourse, we meticulously evaluate Yuan et al.'s research, scrutinizing its merits and limitations, and cast a forward-looking gaze upon the formulation, validation of efficacy, and clinical translation of nanomedicines targeting CAFs.",

To confirm the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the microarray analysis, real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted. In the meantime, the liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS) was employed to characterize the component profile of DWYG. Consequently, the DWYG treatment exhibited the ability to reverse 51 variation genes induced by 2-AAF/PH. Additionally, there was an overlap of 54 variation genes between the normal and model groups. Upon conducting RT-qPCR analysis, it was observed that the expression levels of all genes were increased by 2-AAF/PH and subsequently reversed after DWYG treatment. Notably, the fold change of expression levels for all genes was below 0.5, with 3 genes falling below 0.25. Moreover, an investigation was conducted to determine the signaling pathway that was activated/inhibited in the HCC group and subsequently reversed in the DWYG group.

        "AbstractText": "Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there were reports of diagnostic delays and a surge in the prevalence of advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). We conducted a retrospective study on the impact of COVID-19 on the number of newly diagnosed HNC among patients who underwent screening at our center to understand the temporal changes. We investigated the Union for International Cancer Control guidelines-TNM classification, presence of subjective symptoms at the time of consultation, and initial treatment from the medical records of first-time patients with HNC who visited our head and neck surgery department during 2019-2021 and compared them with those before (2019) and after (2020-2021) the pandemic. A total of 1245 patients were included in the study. The number of patients were 437, 417, and 391 in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, indicating a downward trend following the pandemic. When the incidence of early (stage 0-II) and advanced (stage III-IV) HNC cancers was compared, the proportion of patients with early-stage cancer declined. Among them, significant primary tumor progression was observed in T classification. The number of patients with no subjective symptoms at initial diagnosis was decreasing significantly. A decrease in the proportion of HNC patients with early-stage cancer and primary tumor progression was observed after the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The number of early-stage malignancies may have dropped due to patients' unwillingness to visit a doctor.",

        "AbstractText": "The standard treatment for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is surgery. However, reports on the appropriate extent of bone resection are few. We aimed to examine the relationship between the extent of bone resection and postoperative outcomes in patients with mandibular MRONJ. The clinical and imaging findings and treatment outcomes of 206 patients (258 surgeries) with mandibular MRONJ undergoing surgery were reviewed. Imaging findings were evaluated using computed tomography (CT) to sequestrum, osteolysis, periosteal reaction, and mixed-type osteosclerosis, and determine the extent of resection. In some cases, samples were taken from within the bone, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the presence of bacteria and fungi. The three-year cumulative cure rate was 81.7%. Patients with malignant tumors showing no osteolysis and undergoing sequestrum removal or marginal mandibulectomy had significantly worse prognosis than those with osteoporosis showing osteolysis and undergoing segmental mandibulectomy. Furthermore, patients with residual osteolysis, periosteal reactions, and mixed-type osteosclerosis on CT were more likely to develop recurrence. Eleven patients showed no osteolysis on CT images. Patients with cancer administered with high-dose denosumab had significantly poorer prognosis. Bacteria and fungi were also detected in samples obtained from gap-type periosteal reaction and mixed-type osteosclerosis. Surgery for MRONJ requires resection of the infected bone. Aside from the osteolysis area, the gap-/irregular-type periosteal reaction and mixed-type osteosclerosis must also be included in the resection area. Methods for determining the extent of bone resection in MRONJ without osteolysis are a future challenge.",

        "AbstractText": "Glioblastoma is one of the most devastating central nervous system disorders. Being a highly vascular brain tumor, it is distinguished by aberrant vessel architecture. This lends credence to the idea that endothelial cells (ECs) linked with glioblastoma vary fundamentally from ECs seen in the healthy human brain. To effectively design an antiangiogenic treatment, it is crucial to identify the functional and phenotypic characteristics of tumor-associated ECs. The ECs associated with glioblastoma are less prone to apoptosis than control cells and are resistant to cytotoxic treatments. Additionally, ECs associated with glioblastoma migrate more quickly than control ECs and naturally produce large amounts of growth factors such as endothelin-1, interleukin-8, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For designing innovative antiangiogenic drugs that particularly target tumor-related ECs in gliomas, it is critical to comprehend these distinctive features of ECs associated with gliomas. This review discusses the process of angiogenesis, other factors involved in the genesis of tumors, and the possibility of ECs as a potential target in combating glioblastoma. It also sheds light on the association of tumor microenvironment and ECs with immunotherapy. This review, thus gives us the hope that neuro endothelial targeting with growth factors and angiogenesis regulators combined with gene therapy would open up new doorways and change our traditional perspective of treating cancer.",

All ES-SCLC patients without initial brain metastases who completed \u2265 4 cycles of systemic therapy at Department of Radiation and Medical Oncology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from 2012 to 2021 were included in this retrospective study. We correlated the site of first recurrence to the post-chemotherapy-based radiation volume (small-field). Relapse pattern, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between those received and did not receive consolidation RT. A total of 152 patients were followed up for a median of 31.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 23.9-39.6 months). The median PFS and OS of the cohort were 8.3 months (IQR, 6.1-11.2 months) and 16.2 months (IQR, 9.9-24.9 months), respectively. Thoracic consolidation RT served not only as an independent prognostic factor for improved PFS in the entire cohort, but also significantly prolonged OS in the subgroup without synchronous liver metastases. Small-field consolidation RT markedly reduced in-field recurrences (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12-0.38]; P < 0.001) without increasing out-of-field recurrences (HR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.13-1.16]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.080).

This study aims to compare three types of N classifications, including location-based N classification (pathologic nodal classification [pN]), the number of lymph node stations (nS)-based N classification (nS classification), and the combined approach proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) which incorporates both pN and nS classification to determine if the nS classification is more appropriate for early-stage lung cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of lung cancer patients treated at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2005 and 2018. Inclusion criteria was clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent resection during this period. Sub-analyses were performed for the three types of N classifications. The optimal cutoff values for nS classification were determined with X-tile software. Kaplan\u2012Meier and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to assess the prognostic significance of the different N classifications. The prediction performance among the three types of N classifications was compared using the concordance index (C-index) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Of the 669 patients evaluated, 534 had pathological stage N0 disease (79.8%), 82 had N1 disease (12.3%) and 53 had N2 disease (7.9%). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that all three types of N classifications were independent prognostic factors for prognosis (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, the prognosis overlaps between pN (N1 and N2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.052) and IASLC-proposed N classification (N1b and N2a1 [P\u00a0=\u00a00.407], N2a1 and N2a2 [P\u00a0=\u00a00.364], and N2a2 and N2b [P\u00a0=\u00a00.779]), except for nS classification subgroups (nS0 and nS1 [P\u00a0<\u00a00.001] and nS1 and nS >1 [P\u00a0=\u00a00.006]). There was no significant difference in the C-index values between the three N classifications (P\u00a0=\u00a00.370).

        "AbstractText": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) performs a crucial function in the tumorigenesis and response to immunotherapies of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, a lack of recognized pre-clinical TME-based risk models poses a great challenge to investigating the risk factors correlated with prognosis and treatment responses for patients with ccRCC. Stromal and immune contexture were assessed to calculate the TMErisk score of a large sample of patients with ccRCC from public and real-world cohorts using machine-learning algorithms. Next, analyses for prognostic efficacy, correlations with clinicopathological features, functional enrichment, immune cell distributions, DNA variations, immune response, and heterogeneity were performed and validated. Clinical hub genes, including INAFM2, SRPX, DPYSL3, VSIG4, APLNR, FHL5, A2M, SLFN11, ADAMTS4, IFITM1, NOD2, CCR4, HLA-DQB2, and PLAUR, were identified and incorporated to develop the TMErisk signature. Patients in the TMEhigh risk group (category) exhibited a considerably grim prognosis, and the TMErisk model was shown to independently function as a risk indicator for the overall survival (OS) of ccRCC patients. Expression levels of immune checkpoint genes were substantially increased in TMEhigh risk group, while those of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family genes were prominently decreased. In addition, tumors in the TMEhigh group showed significantly high infiltration levels of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes, including M2 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and CD4+ T cells. In heterogeneity analysis, more frequent somatic mutations, including pro-tumorigenic BAP1 and PBRM1, were observed in the TMEhigh group. Importantly, 19.3% of patients receiving immunotherapies in the TMEhigh group achieved complete or partial response compared with those with immune tolerance in the TMElow group, suggesting that TMErisk prominently differentiates prognosis and responses to immunotherapy for patients with ccRCC. We first established the TMErisk score of ccRCC using machine-learning algorithms based on a large-scale population. The TMErisk score can be utilized as an innovative independent prognosis predictive marker with high sensitivity and accuracy. Our discovery also predicted the efficacy of immunotherapy in ccRCC patients, indicating the intimate link between tumor immune microenvironment and intratumoral heterogeneity.",

After excluding the neoadjuvant setting group, we observed a distinct reduction in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) with an advancement of the line of ICI treatment. The incidence of trAEs was negatively correlated with the line of treatment, irrespective of whether monotherapy or dual-ICI combination therapy was administered. Sensitivity analyses also confirmed the coincident negative correlations. In summary, using a timeline-based concept centered around treatment lines, we revealed the dynamic landscape of ICI-associated toxicity and found that patients treated with ICIs during later lines of therapy may have a lower risk of trAEs.",

Within the miR-545/374a cluster, miR-545 resides in the intron of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FTX on Xq13.2. The precursor form, pre-miR-545, is cleaved to generate two mature miRNAs, miR-545-3p and miR-545-5p. Remarkably, these two miRNAs exhibit distinct aberrant expression patterns in different cancers; however, their expression in colorectal cancer remains controversial. Notably, miR-545-3p is affected by 15 circular RNAs (circRNAs) and 10 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and it targets 27 protein-coding genes (PCGs) that participate in the regulation of four signaling pathways. In contrast, miR-545-5p is regulated by one circRNA and five lncRNAs, it targets six PCGs and contributes to the regulation of one signaling pathway. Both miR-545-3p and miR-545-5p affect crucial cellular behaviors, including cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and migration. Although low miR-545-3p expression is associated with poor prognosis in three cancer types, studies on miR-545-5p are yet to be reported. miR-545-3p operates within a diverse range of regulatory networks, thereby augmenting the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. Conversely, miR-545-5p enhances immunotherapy efficacy by inhibiting T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) expression. In summary, miR-545 holds immense potential as a cancer biomarker and therapeutic target. The aberrant expression and regulatory mechanisms of miR-545 in cancer warrant further investigation.",

        "AbstractText": "Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the preferred treatment for stage IVB cervical cancer; however, some patients experience a poor prognosis. The prognostic significance of body composition indicators, including visceral obesity, has been extensively investigated in patients with cancer. This study aimed to assess the impact of body composition indicators, specifically pretreatment fat content, on the survival outcomes of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. We retrospectively analyzed clinical information from patients diagnosed with stage IVB cervical cancer between 2010 and 2018. We measured visceral obesity (visceral-to-subcutaneous adipose tissue area ratio [VSR]) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) on pretreatment computed tomography (CT) images. We evaluated the impact of these body composition parameters on the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer. Overall, 116 patients were included, 81 of whom had complete clinical and imaging information. Based on the cut-off values from X-tile analysis, we categorized patients into high and low VSR and SMI groups. The overall survival (OS) rate of patients with a high VSR was significantly higher than that of patients with a low VSR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that a low VSR was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer. Visceral obesity before radiotherapy and chemotherapy has a protective effect on the prognosis of patients with stage IVB cervical cancer, while low muscle index and VSR are associated with poor prognosis.",

        "AbstractText": "Betel nut/areca nut/Areca catechu is one of the most commonly used psychoactive substance, and is also a major preventable cause of cancer. Unlike other psychoactive substances, such as nicotine, the mechanisms underlying addiction to areca nuts and related oncogenesis remain elusive. Recent reports suggest a possible overlap in the mechanisms of action of nicotine and areca nuts in the human body. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the interactome of human proteins associated with areca nut exposure and the intricate similarities and differences in the effects of the two psychoactive substances on humans. A list of proteins associated with areca nut use was obtained from the available literature using terms from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional enrichment were analyzed. The results obtained for both psychoactive substances were compared. Given the limited number of common proteins (36/226, 16%) in the two sets, a substantial overlap (612/1176 nodes, 52%) was observed in the PPI networks, as well as in Gene Ontology. Areca nuts mainly affect signaling pathways through three hub proteins (alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase, tumor protein 53, and interleukin-6), which are common to both psychoactive substances, as well as two unique hub proteins (epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a0and\u00a0master regulator of cell cycle entry and proliferative metabolism). Areca nut-related proteins are associated with unique pathways, such as extracellular matrix organization, lipid storage, and metabolism, which are not found in nicotine-associated proteins. Areca nuts affect regulatory mechanisms, leading to systemic toxicity and oncogenesis. Areca nuts also affect unique pathways that can be studied as potential markers of exposure, as well as targets for anticancer therapeutic agents.",

        "AbstractText": "Choroid plexus papilloma (CPP) is a rare, slow-growing, and typically benign brain tumor that predominantly affects children. CPP is characterized by well-defined circular or lobulated masses in the ventricles, leading to symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus. CPP diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histological examination. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorizes choroid plexus tumors into CPP (Grade \u0406), atypical CPP (aCPP, Grade II), and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC, Grade III). This article reviewed current diagnostics modalities and explored the emergence of new diagnostic methods for CPP. Research on molecular markers and genetic alterations associated with CPP is ongoing, and some potential markers have been identified. These results offered insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalized treatment approaches for CPP. Advancements in radiomics and liquid biopsy hold promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring treatment outcomes for choroid plexus tumors. Radiomics can provide quantitative data from imaging studies, whereas liquid biopsy can analyze tumor-derived genetic material and molecular markers from body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. The rapidly evolving fields of molecular and genetic research and novel diagnostic methods require continuous updates and advancements before their application in clinical practice. We hope that these advancements will lead to earlier and more precise diagnoses, better treatment options, and improved outcomes in patients with CPP and other brain tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a novel anti-tumor therapeutic modality, are monoclonal antibodies targeting certain immune checkpoints (ICs) that reactivate T cells to achieve anti-tumor immunity by targeting, binding, and blocking ICs. Targeted inhibitory antibodies against the ICs cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen and programmed death receptor-1 have demonstrated efficacy and durable anti-tumor activity in patients with cancer. ICs may prevent autoimmune reactions. However, ICIs may disrupt ICs properties and trigger autoimmune-related adverse reactions involving various organ systems including the cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, musculoskeletal, dermal, and endocrine systems. Approximately 10% of patients with damage to target organs such as the thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal glands develop endocrine system immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as thyroid dysfunction, pituitary gland inflammation, diabetes mellitus, and primary adrenal insufficiency. However, the symptoms of immunotherapy-associated endocrine system irAEs may be nonspecific and similar to those of other treatment-related adverse reactions, and failure to recognize them early may lead to death. Timely detection and treatment of immunotherapy-associated endocrine irAEs is essential to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy, prognosis, and the quality of life of patients. This study aimed to review the mechanisms by which ICIs cause endocrine irAEs providing guidance for the development of appropriate management protocols. Here, we discuss (1) the biological mechanisms of ICs in tumorigenesis and progression, focusing on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen and programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1; and (2) the epidemiology, clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of four immunotherapy-related endocrine complications.",

Herein, we review the structure-based mechanism of action of dostarlimab and the results of a clinical study (GARNET; NCT02715284) to comprehensively clarify the efficacy and toxicity of the drug. The efficacy and safety of dostarlimab as monotherapy was assessed in a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, multi-cohort trial that included 209 patients with dMMR recurrent or advanced solid tumors after receiving systemic therapy. Patients received 500\u00a0mg of dostarlimab intravenously every three weeks until they were given four doses. Then, patients received 1000\u00a0mg dostarlimab intravenously every six weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The overall response rate, as determined by shrinkage in tumor size, was 41.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 34.9, 48.6), with 34.7 months as the median response duration. In conclusion, dostarlimab is an immunotherapy-based drug that has shown promising results in adult patients with recurrent or advanced dMMR EC.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Approximately 480 people annually in Ireland are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour. Brain tumours are a heterogeneous group of conditions, varying in histopathology, location, and progression. A consistent feature is neurological impairment, which can lead to profound effects on physical and cognitive function. There is evidence that people with brain tumours can benefit from rehabilitation, but pathways are poorly described, and no best practice is defined. This leads to significant unmet need. The aim of this study is to understand the rehabilitation needs of people diagnosed with a brain tumour in Ireland, and gain insight to inform policy and practice. Methods: A prospective, mixed methods study with embedded action research will be conducted. Patients (n=122) with a new diagnosis of primary brain tumour, and optionally, a nominated carer or family member, will be recruited through a national neuro-oncology service. Rehabilitation need (Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory), quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Brain Cancer Module, EuroQol-5D-5L), healthcare utilisation and, optionally, carer needs (Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool) will be assessed at four, eight and 12 months post diagnosis. An embedded qualitative study will invite 30 patients and carers to a semi-structured interview to explore their lived experience of rehabilitation needs and services following brain tumour diagnosis. Finally, using an Action Research approach, healthcare professionals involved in caring for people with brain tumours will be invited to participate in co-operative inquiry groups, to reflect on emerging aggregate findings and identify actions that could be undertaken while the study is underway. Conclusions: By understanding rehabilitation need, the findings will help healthcare professionals and health service providers understand how to prioritise the supports required and encourage policy makers to adequately resource neurorehabilitation to meet the needs of people with a brain tumour diagnosis.",

Regarding the high mortality rate and silent nature of CRC, screening and early detection can meaningfully reduce disease-related deaths. Therefore, for the first time, we aimed to evaluate the early non-invasive diagnosis of CRC via quantitative promoter methylation analysis of RUNX3 and RASSF1A genes in PBMCs. In the present study, we analyzed the methylation status of two important tumor suppressor genes including RUNX3 and RASSF1A in 70 CRC patients and 70 non-malignant subjects using methylation-quantification of endonuclease-resistant DNA (MethyQESD), and a bisulfite conversion-independent method. RUNX3 was significantly hypermethylated in PBMCs of CRC patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). By determining the efficient cutoff value, the sensitivity, and specificity of RUNX3 promoter methylation for CRC diagnosis reached 84.28% and 77.14%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses demonstrated that RUNX3 promoter methylation has high accuracy (areas under the curve [AUC] = 0.840, P < 0.001) for discriminating CRC subjects from healthy individuals. Moreover, RUNX3 methylation levels in PBMCs progressively increased with the stage of the disease (P < 0.001). Although the amount of RASSF1A promoter methylation was not significantly different between CRC patients and controls as well as in different stages of the disease (P > 0.05).

On the basis of gross, radiological, and clinical features alone, ovarian neoplasms cannot be diagnosed. Therefore, a clear histological diagnosis is necessary before beginning a permanent course of therapy. Cross-sectional analytical study. In this ambispective study, a total of 480 patients with ovarian tumors were included from January 2015 to July 2022 at a tertiary care center in western Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics-percentages, mean, and Chi-square test (to calculate P value) were used to analyze the collected data. To determine clinical presentation, age distribution and incidence of various morphological and histological variants of ovarian tumors. Out of 480, 250 cases (52%) in 41-50 years of age, followed by 154 cases (32%) in 21-30 years of age. Our study showed 301 cases of benign, 42 cases of borderline, and 137 cases of malignant neoplasms of ovary out of 480 cases studied. Out of 480 cases, 244 cases (50.83%) were cystic, 138 cases (28.75%) were solid, and 98 cases (20.42%) were mixed (cystic/solid). Out of 480 cases, 326 cases (67.91%) were surface epithelial ovarian neoplasms. In this research, most frequent ovarian neoplasms were serous tumors in 216 cases (45%) followed by mucinous tumors in 78 cases (16.25%). In 96% cases, clinical diagnosis matched with histopathological diagnosis. In our research, benign ovarian neoplasms were most frequent. Serous tumors were the most frequent type of surface epithelial neoplasms followed by mucinous tumors. Peak incidence was seen in fifth decade. Higher risk of malignancy was seen in nulliparity or low parity and early menarche not associated with risk of malignancy. Cystic morphology more common in benign neoplasms and complex or solid morphology showed greatest increase in incidence of malignancy.

However, their exact incidence is not known and data on their epidemiological characteristics are not available. The aim of this study is to study the epidemiologic characteristics of multiple primary cancers in the eastern region of India. The study was conducted in the Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical College, Kolkata, from 2017 to 2020 over a period of 3 years. All patients with a diagnosis of second primary as per International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) definition or those developing a second primary within the study period were included for analysis. Data were recorded in form of preformed questionnaires. All the cases were followed up for at least 12 months. Fifty cases of multiple primary tumors were identified, out of which 21 were synchronous while rest 29 were metachronous type. The male-female ratio was 1:1.2. The median age at presentation for index malignancy was 50 years. The most common malignancy in the synchronous group was a combination of variety of GI cancers (six cases). In the metachronous category, a combination of reproductive cancers (breast, ovary, cervix, and endometrium) along with Gastrointestinal cancer (GI) cancers (colon, rectum) was most frequently found (eight cases). Definite risk factors for multiple primary tumors were identifiable in 10 cases: arsenic exposure in 5 cases, hereditary in 4 cases, and immunosuppression in 1, while in 8 cases, risk factors were only speculative (radiation 5 cases, chemotherapy 3). At the time of the last follow-up, 36 subjects were alive and 3 dead while the status of 11 subjects was unknown. This is the first comprehensive study on multiple primary cancers and the largest so far in India. Our study overcomes the shortcoming of previous case series from our subcontinent. The merits of our study include the use of the most accepted IARC definition, updated staging guidelines with long follow-up, and reliable survival data. Additionally, we could identify risk factors in 50% of our subjects. And our study shows various new combinations of cancers not reported before. Clustering of cases in the young adolescent group (25-49) years is also a new finding. We also highlight the existing ambiguity in the way this entity is defined. Demerits include the loss of follow-up data in a significant number of patients.",

Contrary to this, in India, which is a low-incidence country for CRCs, the incidence among all age groups including the young is rising. This study aimed at describing the clinico-demographic profile of young CRC cases and the epidemiological trend of the proportion of young cases from 2014 to 2021 in a tertiary cancer center in Eastern India. This retrospective observational study was conducted at Department of Radiation Oncology, State Cancer Institute, IGIMS Patna, India a prominent tertiary cancer care center of Bihar. All histopathologically confirmed CRC cases in the 0-39 years age group were considered young and evaluated for the clinical, demographic profile as well as yearly trends in proportion out of total CRC cases. Microsoft Excel (2021) was used for statistical analysis. A P value of 0.05 was considered significant. Young colorectal (less than 40 years) patients constituted a third (n = 344, 33.4%) of total colorectal (n = 1028) cases. The median age among the young CRC cases was 30 years (range: 12 to 39 years). Rectum was the most common subsite noted (n = 255,74.1%) among this group of young patients.

A total of 100 cases of which 57 neuroendocrine neoplasms and 43 nonneuroendocrine neoplasms were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done and expression patterns of INSM1 were analyzed. Pituitary adenoma, medullary carcinoma of thyroid, pheochromocytoma lung, gastrointestinal, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were the neuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. Papillary carcinoma of thyroid, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma were the nonneuroendocrine tumors that were included in the study. Depending upon the tissue availability, comparison of INSM1 with synaptophysin and chromogranin was also done in few neuroendocrine tumors. All the 57 neuroendocrine tumors showed positive expression for INSM1 and all the nonneuroendocrine tumors were negative for INSM1. This study is statistically significant. Our study suggests that INSM1 is a diagnostic marker for neuroendocrine tumors with high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The study is significant and suggests that INSM1- IHC shows nuclear positivity in a spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors. Being a nuclear marker, interpretation is easy and more reliable than the cytoplasmic markers. INSM1 has a stronger positivity than synaptophysin and chromogranin in the present study especially for small cell carcinoma lung. Hence, INSM1 may be included in the routine panel for neuroendocrine tumors along with synaptophysin and chromogranin.",

Thirty patients who had received definitive curative-intent treatment for histopathology-proven malignant head and neck tumors and in whom recurrent tumor was detected on precontrast MR imaging (MRI) were accrued in the study. Patients underwent DCE-MR perfusion imaging. Time to peak (TTP), relative maximum enhancement (RME), and relative washout (RWO) ratio were calculated by using time-intensity curve (TIC). The diagnostic accuracy was compared with histopathology. A cut-off value of \u2265125.3 for RME showed a sensitivity of 76.2% and specificity of 66.7% for differentiating post-radiation changes and recurrence.

Molecular cancer studies led to the development of kinase inhibitors, among which sorafenib stands out as a multi-kinase inhibitor approved by FDA for first line use in HCC patients. However, the efficiency of sorafenib was shown to be counteracted by numerous subcellular pathways involving the effector kinase AKT, causing resistance and limiting its survival benefit. On the way of breaking such resistance mechanisms and increase the efficiency of sorafenib, deeper understanding of hepatocellular physiology is essential. Thyroid hormones were shown to be metabolized in liver and inevitably affect the molecular behaviour of hepatocytes. Interestingly, thyroid hormone T3 was also demonstrated to be potentially influential in liver regeneration and treatment with this hormone reportedly led to a decrease in HCC tumor growths. In this study, we aimed to uncover the impact of T3 hormone on the cytotoxic response to sorafenib in HCC in vitro. We pre-treated the HCC cell line Huh-7 with T3 prior to sorafenib exposure both in 2D and 3D culture. We checked cell viability with MTT assay in 2D culture and measured the sizes of 3D spheroids with bright-field microscopy followed by a surface analysis with ImageJ. We also performed scratch assay to measure cell migration as well as western blot and qPCR to uncover affected pathways. We observed an additive effect to sorafenib's cytotoxicity both in 2D and 3D culture. Cell migration assay also confirmed our finding and pointed out a benefit of T3 hormone in HCC cell migration. Western blot experiments showed that T3 exerts its additive effect by suppressing AKT expression upon sorafenib treatment both at protein and gene expression levels. Our results open a promising new avenue in increasing sorafenib's cytotoxicity where thyroid hormone T3 is utilized to modulate AKT expression to combat resistance, and warrant further studies in the field.",

Herein, signal, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio of lymph nodes and overall image quality, artifact, and noise of selected regions of interest were evaluated by two radiologists. Next, cervical lymph node sharpness was evaluated using full width at half maximum. DLIR exhibited significantly reduced noise, ranging from 3.8 % to 35.9 % with improved signal-to-noise ratio (11.5-105.6 %) and contrast-to-noise ratio (10.5-107.5 %) compared with FBP and ASiR-V, for cervical lymph nodes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

        "AbstractText": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had affected clinical practice in several ways, including the restriction of nonessential endoscopic procedures. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate how colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis and management was affected during the first year of pandemics in Portugal. This is a Portuguese substudy of the French retrospective multicentric study ETICC (Etude de l'Impact de la pand\u00e9mie COVID-19 sur le diagnostic et la prise en charge du Cancer Colorectal). We compared patients' characteristics, clinical manifestations, CRC staging at diagnosis, delay to first medical appointment, histological diagnosis, surgical and medical treatments between the year previous to the pandemics (control) and the first year of pandemics. We included 766 patients: 496 in the control group and 270 in the COVID group. There was no significant difference in CRC staging at diagnosis between both groups, with 21% being diagnosed as metastatic in the control group and 22% in the first year of pandemics (p = 0.770). Contrary to what happened in France, there was a significant decrease in CRC diagnosis in asymptomatic patients (25-8.4%; p < 0.001) and after a positive fecal immunochemical test (20.8-11.3%; p = 0.002) during the pandemics. Although the increase in the overall complication rate at diagnosis was nonsignificant, in Portugal, there was a significant increase in diagnosis of abdominal occlusion (12.1-18.1%; p = 0.033). In Portugal, time between the beginning of symptoms and the first medical appointment significantly increased from a median of 50 days to 64 days during COVID (p < 0.001). On the contrary, time between histological diagnosis and tumor resection had significantly decreased from a median of 65 to 39 days (p < 0.001). Time between histological diagnosis and neoadjuvant treatment was not statistically different (median of 64-67 days; p = 0.590), as was time between histological diagnosis and palliative chemotherapy (median of 50-51 days; p = 1.000). Time from CRC resection and adjuvant treatment has significantly decreased from a median of 54 to 43 days (p = 0.001). We found a significant impact in CRC diagnosis in the first year of pandemics, more pronounced than what was found in France. These are likely related not only with the closing of endoscopy units but also with the difficulties patients had in finding an appointment with their general practitioners. On the other hand, both in France and Portugal, the first year of pandemics did not worsen CRC staging at diagnosis and did not significantly affect medical and surgical treatments once the diagnosis was made.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Portuguese Pancreatic Club Perspectives on Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided and Surgical Treatment of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.",
        "AbstractText": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs) are a group of neoplasms with heterogenous biological and clinical phenotypes. Although historically regarded as rare, the incidence of these tumors has been increasing, mostly owing to improvements in the detection of small, asymptomatic tumors with imaging. The heterogeneity of these lesions creates significant challenges regarding diagnosis, staging, and treatment. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has improved the characterization of pancreatic lesions. Furthermore, EUS nowadays has evolved from a purely diagnostic modality to allow the performance of minimally invasive locoregional therapy for pancreatic focal lesions. The choice of treatment as well as the treatment goals depend on several factors, including tumor secretory status, grading, staging, and patient performance status. Surgery has been the mainstay for the management of these patients, particularly for localized, low-grade, large panNETs >2 cm. Over the last decade, a significant body of evidence has been accumulated evaluating the role of EUS for the ablative therapy of panNETs, namely by the use of chemoablative agents and radiofrequency. Although endoscopic techniques are not routinely recommended by international guidelines, they may be considered for the treatment of smaller lesions in patients who are unwilling or unfit for pancreatic surgery. In this review, we summarize the existing evidence on the interventional techniques for the treatment of patients with panNETs, focusing on the EUS-guided and surgical approaches.",

The authors performed a retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with GNET diagnosed between 2010 and 2019, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. We included 132 patients with GNET (type I, 113 patients; type II, 1 patient; type III, 14 patients; type IV, 2 patients; not classifiable, 2 patients), with 61% being female and a mean age at diagnosis of 66 years. During the follow-up period (median 66 months), 3 (2.3%) patients died due to metastatic disease (1 patient with type III and 2 patients with type IV). Male gender (p = 0.030), type III/IV (p < 0.001), Ki-67 index >20% (p < 0.001), grade 2/3 (p < 0.001), invasion beyond the submucosa (p < 0.001), and presence of metastases (p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors for mortality in the univariate analysis. Metastasis developed in 7 patients (5.3%). Multivariable analysis revealed that Ki-67 >20% (p = 0.016) was an independent risk factor for metastasis. Overall, CgA showed a sensitivity of 20% for detection of recurrence and a specificity of 79% (sensitivity of 8% and specificity of 71% in type I GNETs). Identification of risk factors for the presence of metastases and for mortality in these groups of patients can help in individualizing the therapeutic strategy. CgA seems to be a weak marker for monitoring patients with GNET.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging is a contributor to liver disease. Hence, the concept of liver aging has become prominent and has attracted considerable interest, but its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In our study, the internal mechanism of liver aging was explored via multi-omics analysis and molecular experiments to support future targeted therapy. An aged rat liver model was established with d-galactose, and two other senescent hepatocyte models were established by treating HepG2 cells with d-galactose and H2O2. We then performed transcriptomic and metabolomic assays of the aged liver model and transcriptome analyses of the senescent hepatocyte models. In livers, genes related to peroxisomes, fatty acid elongation, and fatty acid degradation exhibited down-regulated expression with aging, and the hepatokine Fgf21 expression was positively correlated with the down-regulation of these genes. In senescent hepatocytes, similar to the results found in aged livers, FGF21 expression was also decreased. Moreover, the expressions of cell cycle-related genes were significantly down-regulated, and the down-regulated gene E2F8 was the key cell cycle-regulating transcription factor. We then validated that FGF21 overexpression can protect against liver aging and that FGF21 can attenuate the declines in the antioxidant and regenerative capacities in the aging liver. We successfully validated the results from cellular and animal experiments using human liver and blood samples. Our study indicated that FGF21 is an important target for inhibiting liver aging and suggested that pharmacological prevention of the reduction in FGF21 expression due to aging may be used to treat liver aging-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Transcriptional factor Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) plays an important role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying its dysregulation remain unclear. We identified and functionally validated the microRNAs (miRNAs) that critically regulate FOXM1 expression in PDAC. The expression levels of miRNA-23a (miR-23a-3p and -5p) were altered in PDAC cell lines and their effects on FOXM1 signaling and cell proliferation and migration and tumorigenesis were examined in vitro and in vivo using mouse PDAC models. Compared with non-tumor pancreatic tissues, PDAC tissues and cell lines exhibited significantly reduced levels of miR-23a expression. Reduced miR-23a expression and concomitant increase in FOXM1 expression were also observed in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, the major premalignant lesions of PDAC. Transgenic expression of miR-23a reduced the expression of FOXM1 and suppressed cell proliferation and migration in PDAC cells, whereas the inhibitors of miR-23a did the opposite. Loss or reduced levels of miR-23a increased the levels of FOXM1 expression, while increased expression of FOXM1 down-regulated miR-23a expression, suggesting that miR-23a and FOXM1 were mutual negative regulators of their expression in PDAC cells. Therefore, the miR-23a/FOXM1 signaling axis is important in PDAC initiation and progression and could serve as an interventional or therapeutic target for patients with early or late stages of PDAC.",

The pooled hazard ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), as well as the pooled odds ratio (OR) of objective response rate (ORR), were calculated with stratification of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and nonviral subgroup, and the heterogeneity between different etiological subgroups was assessed by using an interaction test. Eight eligible studies with a total of 5,646 patients were identified from searching published articles and conference abstracts. ICI therapies were associated with significantly prolonged OS with the pooled HRs of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.84, p < 0.001), 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.79, p < 0.001), 0.80 (95% CI 0.69-0.93, p = 0.003), and 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.97, p = 0.011) for the whole population, HBV subgroup, HCV subgroup, and non-viral subgroup, respectively.

Patients with VTE were identified using ICD-10 codes from all primary discharge diagnoses. Only deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were considered. Patients with VTE were further divided into groups: esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer, and compared with patients who did not have these malignancies. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was calculated using multivariate regression analysis. Among 999,559 patients discharged with a VTE diagnosis, 25,775 (2.6%) had one of the four GI malignancies. Among patients with one of the four included GI malignancy diagnosis, 18,816 (73%) patients had PE and 6,959 (27%) patients had DVT. The study shows that adults admitted to the hospitals for VTE have higher mortality when compared to patients who did not have GI malignancies, with esophageal cancer having the highest inpatient mortality with an aOR of 2.701; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.989-3.669, p value <0.000.

Such methods as transanal excision, transanal endoscopic microsurgery, and transanal minimally invasive surgery can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. However, not all patients are suitable candidates for these procedures, and proper diagnostics are necessary to establish indications. Compared to total mesorectal excision, transanal excision techniques have been shown to have fewer complications and comorbidities while still being able to remove cancerous tissue entirely. Transanal excision is the simplest method, where the operator removes visible rectal lesions. The basic principle of transanal endoscopic microsurgery is to dilate the rectum mechanically and by air insufflation and then use special surgical instruments to remove suspicious lesions under the vision of a telescope. Transanal minimally invasive surgery combines transanal endoscopic microsurgery and single-incision laparoscopic surgery, making the hard-to-reach proximal rectum accessible to classic laparoscopic instruments. Local excision techniques, when used as a monotherapy for treating patients with rectal cancer, have established themselves as a curative and less radical treatment for strictly selected patients with early rectal carcinoma, leading to improved quality of life. When combined with other modalities such as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, total neoadjuvant therapy, and immunotherapy, transanal surgery can be offered to patients with locally advanced rectal cancer as part of the organ preservation strategy. This review will discuss the patient selection and technical aspects of transanal surgery, showcasing its current role in treating rectal carcinoma.",

Immune cell frequencies were assessed using mass cytometry in whole blood samples at 12\u2009months. The infants clustered into four groups based on immune cell composition: clusters 1 and 2 showed a high relative abundance of na\u00efve cells, cluster 3 exhibited increased abundance of classical- and non-classical monocytes and clusters 3 and 4 had elevated neutrophil levels. At all age groups, we did observe significant associations between the gut microbiota and immune cell clusters; however, these were generally from low abundant species.

We compared the initial reports by extramural radiologists and an in-house radiologist specialized in orbital imaging to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of orbital imaging. This was a retrospective chart review of forty patients referred to a Tertiary Eye Care Center in South India over a period of 7 years. These patients already had their imaging done elsewhere. The imaging was re-evaluated by an in-house radiologist. The radiological findings were correlated with the histopathological diagnosis. The diagnostic accuracy between the two radiologists was compared. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value in differentiating malignant from benign lesions were calculated in both groups. The sensitivity and PPV of the radiological diagnosis for neoplastic and inflammatory lesions in both groups were analyzed. The accuracy in differentiating malignant from benign and inflammatory lesions by our in-house radiologist and extramural radiologists was 95% (\u03ba = 0.9 [0.764, 0.997]) and 50% (\u03ba = 0.036 [-0.160, 0.232]), respectively. The sensitivity and PPV of the radiological diagnosis by our in-house radiologist were 93.31% and 100% for benign lesions and 95.24% and 95.24% for malignant lesions. On the contrary, reports from the extramural radiologists showed a sensitivity and PPV of 76.92% and 66.67% for benign lesions and 14.28% and 60% for malignant lesions. A high radiological diagnostic accuracy is possible when analyzed by radiologists experienced in orbital imaging.",

        "AbstractText": "Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) remains the most prevailing unfavorable influence and may affect its clinical usage. This study sought to explore the possible impacts of curcumin on preventing CIN in human subjects. The investigation was a placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted on 82 patients receiving nano-curcumin (80 mg twice daily for five days) or an identical placebo with standard nephroprotective modalities against CIN. Data was gathered on patients' demographics, blood, urinary nitrogen, creatinine (Cr) levels, urinary electrolytes, and urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in treatment and placebo groups, 24 h and five days after initiating the administration of cisplatin. Both investigation groups were alike considering the demographic characteristics and clinical baseline data. Curcumin administration led to a significant improvement in blood-urine nitrogen (BUN). BUN, Cr, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the ratio of NGAL-to-Cr considerably altered during the follow-up periods. However, the further alterations in other indices, including urinary sodium, potassium, magnesium, NGAL values, and potassium-to-Cr ratio were not statistically noteworthy. The significant differences in the NGAL-to-Cr ratio between the two groups may indicate the potential protective impact of curcumin supplementation against tubular toxicity. Curcumin management was safe and well-accepted; only insignificant gastrointestinal side effects were reported. Curcumin supplementation may have the potential to alleviate CIN and urinary electrolyte wasting in cancer patients. Future research investigating the effects of a longer duration of follow-up, a larger participant pool, and a higher dosage of curcumin are recommended.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Caesalpinia sappan extract (CSE) on cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, ROS generation, and stemness markers of MDA-MB-231 and its BCSCs. Caesalpinia sappan was extracted under maceration with methanol. Magnetic-activated cell sorting was used to isolate BCSCs based on CD44+ and CD24- cell surface expression. The MTT test was used to assess the cytotoxic effects of CSE on MDA-MB-231 and BCSCs. Moreover, flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, ROS level, and CD44/CD24 level. Using qRT-PCR, the gene expression of the stemness markers NANOG, SOX-2, OCT-4, and c-MYC was assessed. We found that MDA-MB-231 contains 80% of the BCSCs population, and CSE showed more potent cytotoxicity toward BCSCs than MDA-MB-231. CSE caused apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and BCSCs cells by increasing the level of ROS. Furthermore, CSE significantly reduced the MDA-MB-231 stemness marker CD44+/CD24- and the mRNA levels of pluripotent markers of cells in BCSCs. CSE potentially reduces BCSCs stemness, which may be mediated by the elevation of the ROS levels and reduction of the expression levels of stemness transcription.",

Metformin and gallic acid did not cause toxicity in normal cells. They had a stronger combined impact on ROS induction. Metformin and Gallic acid resulted in cell cycle arrest in the sub-G1 phase with G1 and S phase arrest, respectively. Increased levels of LC3 and Beclin-1 markers along with decreased P62 markers were observed in cancerous cells, which is consistent with the anticancer properties of metformin and gallic acid.

In this study, two new variants of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), designated EG3-1 and EG3-2, were designed to increase their affinity for HER2 receptors. To this end, DARPin G3 was selected as a template, and six-point mutations comprising Q26E, I32V, T49A, L53H, K101R, and G124V were created on its structure. Furthermore, the 3D structures were formed through homology modeling and evaluated using molecular dynamic simulation. Then, both structures were docked to the HER2 receptor using the HADDOCK web tool, followed by 100 ns of molecular dynamics simulation for both DARPins / HER2 complexes. The theoretical result confirmed both structures' stability. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the applied mutations on DARPin EG3-2 significantly improve the receptor binding affinity of DARPin. The computationally engineered DARPin EG3-2 in this study could provide a hit compound for the design of promising anticancer agents targeting HER2 receptors.",

To comprehensively understand the internal exposure risks of metal(loid)s from copper smelting, we explored eighteen metal(loid)s and arsenic metabolites in the urine of both occupational and non-occupational populations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with high-performance liquid chromatography and compared their health risks. Results showed that zinc and copper (485.38 and 14.00 \u00b5g/L), and arsenic, lead, cadmium, vanadium, tin and antimony (46.80, 6.82, 2.17, 0.40, 0.44 and 0.23 \u00b5g/L, respectively) in workers (n=179) were significantly higher compared to controls (n=168), while Zinc, tin and antimony (412.10, 0.51 and 0.15 \u00b5g/L, respectively) of residents were significantly higher than controls. Additionally, workers had a higher monomethyl arsenic percentage (MMA%), showing lower arsenic methylation capacity. Source appointment analysis identified arsenic, lead, cadmium, antimony, tin and thallium as co-exposure metal(loid)s from copper smelting, positively relating to the age of workers. The hazard index (HI) of workers exceeded 1.0, while residents and control were approximately at 1.0. Besides, all three populations had accumulated cancer risks exceeding 1.0 \u00d7 10-4, and arsenite (AsIII) was the main contributor to the variation of workers and residents. Furthermore, residents living closer to the smelting plant had higher health risks.

There is increasing evidence that exposure to EDCs can have profound adverse effects on reproduction, metabolic disorders, neurological alterations, and increased risk of hormone-dependent cancer. Stem cells (SCs) are integral to these pathological processes, and it is therefore crucial to understand how EDCs may influence SC functionality. This review examines the literature on different types of EDCs and their effects on various types of SCs, including embryonic, adult, and cancer SCs. Possible molecular mechanisms through which EDCs may influence the phenotype of SCs are also evaluated. Finally, the possible implications of these effects on human health are discussed. The available literature demonstrates that EDCs can influence the biology of SCs in a variety of ways, including by altering hormonal pathways, DNA damage, epigenetic changes, reactive oxygen species production and alterations in the gene expression patterns. These disruptions may lead to a variety of cell fates and diseases later in adulthood including increased risk of endocrine disorders, obesity, infertility, reproductive abnormalities, and cancer. Therefore, the review emphasizes the importance of raising broader awareness regarding the intricate impact of EDCs on human health.",

Maturation of IL-10 producing B-cells was suppressed by FTI at high concentrations as well as induction of GrB-secreting B-cells. Plasma blast formation and IgG secretion were potently suppressed by FTI. Moreover, purified B-cells from immunosuppressed renal transplant patients were also susceptible to FTI-induced suppression of effector functions, evidenced by diminished IgG secretion. FTI suppress in vitro B-cell proliferation and plasma cell formation while partially preserving IL-10 as well as GrB production of B-cells.

        "AbstractText": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare but life-threatening malignancy that arises in the setting of immunosuppression (IS) after solid organ transplant. IS regimens containing belatacept have been associated with an increased risk of PTLD in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative renal transplant recipients, and the use of belatacept is contraindicated in this population. However, the impact of belatacept-based regimens on PTLD risk and outcomes in EBV-seropositive renal transplant recipients is less well characterized. A case-control study was conducted to investigate how combinatorial IS regimens impact the risk of PTLD and survival outcomes in renal transplant recipients at a large transplant center between 2010 and 2019. In total, 17 cases of PTLD were identified and matched 1:2 to controls without PTLD by age, sex, and transplanted organ(s). We compared baseline clinical characteristics, examined changes in IS regimen, viral loads, and renal function over time, and evaluated time-to-event analyses, including graft rejection and survival. Cases of PTLD largely resembled matched controls in terms of baseline characteristics, although expected differences in EBV serostatus trended toward significance (42.9% of PTLD cases were donor-positive/recipient-negative vs. 8.3% controls, p\u2009=\u20090.063). PTLD cases were not more likely to have received belatacept than controls. Belatacept was not associated with graft rejection or failure, re-transplant, hospitalization, or decreased survival. Belatacept was not associated with an increased risk of PTLD, and was not associated with decreased survival in either PTLD cases or in the entire cohort. Our case-control study supports the concept that belatacept remains a safe and effective option for IS in EBV-seropositive renal transplant patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Autologous chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR T) products have demonstrated un-precedent efficacy in treating many relapsed/refractory B-cell and plasma cell malignancies, leading to multiple commercial products now in routine clinical use. These positive responses to CAR T therapy have spurred biotech and big pharma companies to evaluate innovative production methods to increase patient access while maintaining adequate quality control and profitability. Autologous cellular therapies are, by definition, manufactured as single patient batches, and demand has soared for manufacturing facilities compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. The use of a centralized production model is straining finite resources even in developed countries in North America and the European Union, and patient access is not feasible for most of the developing world. The idea of having a more uniform availability of these cell therapy products promoted the concept of point-of-care (POC) manufacturing or decentralized in-house production. While this strategy can potentially decrease the cost of manufacturing, the challenge comes in maintaining the same quality as currently available centrally manufactured products due to the lack of standardized manufacturing techniques amongst institutions. However, academic medical institutions and biotech companies alike have forged ahead innovating and adopting new technologies to launch clinical trials of CAR T products produced exclusively in-house. Here we discuss POC production of CAR T products.",

The correlation between pathologic complete response (PCR) and radiologic complete response (RCR) was determined as the primary aim. As a secondary aim, the correlation between pathologic partial response (PPR) and radiologic partial response (RPR) was determined. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the predictive value of CT in determining disease burden at RC. A total of 141 patients were identified for analysis. PCR and PPR was achieved in 34% and 16% of patients, respectively. The positive predictive value of post-NAC CT was 53.5% for PCR and 28.8% for PPR. The negative predictive value of post-NAC CT was 73.5% for PCR and 46.2% for PPR. There was no significant association between RCR and PCR (OR 1.13, p\u200a=\u200a0.67). Similarly, there was no meaningful association between RPR and PPR, lymph node involvement, or presence of extravesical disease.

We compared epigenetic profiles in monocytes from NMIBC patients with early disease recurrence with those from recurrence-free patients. We conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) on monocytes from seven patients treated with BCG (four with early recurrences and three recurrence-free after one year) to determine genome-wide distribution and abundance of histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) prior to and after five weeks of induction therapy. Genome-wide H3K4me3 profiles before or after BCG induction distinguished patients with early recurrences from those remaining recurrence-free. Furthermore, H3K4me3 levels at genes involved in specific pathways were increased in the recurrence-free group. Independent quantification showed increased H3K4me3 levels in elements of the Wnt and AMPK signaling pathways in the recurrence-free group before BCG initiation, while elements of the MAPK showed increased levels after five weeks of induction in the same group. Validation of these genes on an independent cohort of four additional patients that remained recurrence-free after one year and three with early recurrences revealed consistent increases in H3K4me3 levels associated with MAPK pathway genes after five weeks of BCG treatment in the recurrence-free group. Recurrence-free survival following BCG immunotherapy for NMIBC is associated with the accumulation of H3K4me3 at specific gene loci, and could lead to identification of prognostic biomarkers.",

        "AbstractText": "For decades, immunotherapies have been integral for the treatment and management of bladder cancer, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) transforming patient care in recent years. However, response rates are poor to T cell-targeted ICIs such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibodies, framing a critical need for complementary immunotherapies. Promising strategies involve harnessing the activation potential of natural killer (NK) cells. They quickly exert their antitumor activity via signaling through germline-encoded activating receptors and are rapidly sensitized to new tissue microenvironments via their regulation by polymorphic HLA class I, KIR and NKG2A receptors. In this review, we examined the roles of currently available NK-targeted antitumor treatment strategies such as engineered viral vectors, small-molecule IMiDs, NK agonist antibodies, interleukins, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells, and their potential for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of bladder cancer. Through review of current literature, we summarized our knowledge of NK cells in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies as their roles pertain to novel immunotherapies already being applied to the treatment of bladder cancer or that offer rationale for considering as potential novel immunotherapeutic strategies. NK cells play a critical role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) that can be exploited to improve T cell-targeted immunotherapies. Emerging evidence suggests that NK cells are a prime target for improving antitumor functions in immunotherapies for the treatment of bladder cancer. Further research into profiling NK cells in settings of immunotherapies for bladder cancer could help identify patients who might maximally benefit from NK cell-targeted immunotherapies and the various approaches for exploiting their antitumor properties.",

Examples include measurements of spine bone mineral density, cancer growth through mammography or biopsy, a progression of defective vision, or assessment of gait in patients with neurological disorders. Practitioners often need to infer the progression of diseases from such sparse observations. A classical tool for analyzing such data is a mixed-effect model where time is treated as both a fixed effect (population progression curve) and a random effect (individual variability). Alternatively, researchers use Gaussian processes or functional data analysis, assuming that observations are drawn from a certain distribution of processes. While these models are flexible, they rely on probabilistic assumptions, require very careful implementation, and tend to be slow in practice. In this study, we propose an alternative elementary framework for analyzing longitudinal data motivated by matrix completion. Our method yields estimates of progression curves by iterative application of the Singular Value Decomposition. Our framework covers multivariate longitudinal data, and regression and can be easily extended to other settings. As it relies on existing tools for matrix algebra, it is efficient and easy to implement. We apply our methods to understand trends of progression of motor impairment in children with Cerebral Palsy. Our model approximates individual progression curves and explains 30% of the variability. Low-rank representation of progression trends enables identification of different progression trends in subtypes of Cerebral Palsy.",

We calculated the ethnicity-stratified 5-year age-adjusted incidence rates of BCa using the US SEER database. We performed somatic mutational-signature analyses and compared the APOBEC-related mutational contribution across BCa tumors in patients of different ethnicities. We analyzed the allele frequency distribution of APOBEC3-related rs1014971 in contemporary populations of different ethnicities and in ancient human genomes. We also analyzed the natural selection profiles and ages of the investigated SNPs. We validated the ethnic difference in BCa risk using US SEER data, revealing Caucasians to be at >2-fold greater risk than Asians / Pacific islanders. In contemporary populations, we observed a coherent ethnic distribution in terms not only of the allele frequency of APOBEC3-related rs1014971, but also the mutational contribution of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in BCa tumors. Population genetics and ancient genome analyses further suggested that the diverse ethnic distribution of rs1014971 could be rooted in human evolution. It is possible that APOBEC3-related rs1014971 is involved in the different BCa incidence across ethnic groups, and this difference is potentially derived from human evolution.

        "AbstractText": "With the exception of the FDA-approved valrubicin and pembrolizumab, there are no standard second-line treaments for BCG-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). To provide a systematic review of the novel intravesically administered therapeutic agents for the salvage treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. Online search of the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases was performed. The endpoints of this review were to evaluate the efficacy of the agents in terms of complete response rates (CR) and durability of CR, overall survival, recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific survival and to report on their toxicity profile. A search on Clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify ongoing clinical trials. 14 studies were included in this review. The critical clinical need for the development of an effective, safe and durable intravesical drug for the salvage treatment of high-risk NMIBC seems to be met mainly by intravesical gene therapy; in fact, data support the FDA-approved nadofaragene firadenovec as a potentially important therapeutic advancement in this context. Promising results are also being obtained by the combination of N-803/BCG and by innovative drug delivery systems. Considering the plethora of novel intravesical treatments that have completed phase II evaluation, one can reasonably expect that clinicians will soon have at their disposal new agents and treatment options for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC. In the near future, it will be up to the urologist to identify, for each specific patient, the right agent to use, based on safety, results and cost-effectiveness.",

Recent studies have shown that epigenetic modifications are key drivers of cancer development and progression. Nevertheless, the mechanistic role of epigenetic dysregulation in the tumor microenvironment is not fully understood. Here, we reviewed the role of epigenetic modifications of cancer cells and non-cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment and recent research advances in cancer epigenetic drugs. In addition, we discussed the great potential of epigenetic combination therapies in the clinical treatment of cancer. However, there are still some challenges in the field of cancer epigenetics, such as epigenetic tumor heterogeneity, epigenetic drug heterogeneity, and crosstalk between epigenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, and other omics, which may be the focus and difficulty of cancer treatment in the future. In conclusion, epigenetic modifications in the tumor microenvironment are essential for future epigenetic drug development and the comprehensive treatment of cancer.

        "AbstractText": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced NAD+ (NADH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+)/reduced NADP+ (NADPH) are essential metabolites involved in multiple metabolic pathways and cellular processes. NAD+ and NADH redox couple plays a vital role in catabolic redox reactions, while NADPH is crucial for cellular anabolism and antioxidant responses. Maintaining NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis is crucial for normal physiological activity and is tightly regulated through various mechanisms, such as biosynthesis, consumption, recycling, and conversion between NAD(H) and NADP(H). The conversions between NAD(H) and NADP(H) are controlled by NAD kinases (NADKs) and NADP(H) phosphatases [specifically, metazoan SpoT homolog-1 (MESH1) and nocturnin (NOCT)]. NADKs facilitate the synthesis of NADP+ from NAD+, while MESH1 and NOCT convert NADP(H) into NAD(H). In this review, we summarize the physiological roles of NAD(H) and NADP(H) and discuss the regulatory mechanisms governing NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis in three key aspects: the transcriptional and posttranslational regulation of NADKs, the role of MESH1 and NOCT in maintaining NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis, and the influence of the circadian clock on NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis. In conclusion, NADKs, MESH1, and NOCT are integral to various cellular processes, regulating NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis. Dysregulation of these enzymes results in various human diseases, such as cancers and metabolic disorders. Hence, strategies aiming to restore NAD(H) and NADP(H) homeostasis hold promise as novel therapeutic approaches for these diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "During pregnancy, many patients may experience changes in the size or characteristics of pigmented lesions including common and dysplastic nevi. These changes can be a cause for concern for the patient and their physician due to the potential for melanoma. Over the past several decades conflicting data has been reported about the relationship between pregnancy and the peripartum period and melanocytic nevi/melanoma. Although recent evidence suggests that prognosis is not worse among pregnant patients who develop melanoma, the discovery of several distinct types of estrogen receptors present in skin and effects of other hormones on melanoma suggest possible mechanisms through which melanocytic lesions may evolve. Many observations among patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome and those without this diagnosis can provide some evidence for how and why melanocytic lesions may change during pregnancy and provide support for clinical decisions in managing such concerns. Here we describe the case of a 27-year-old female who presented to the clinic with concerns of two moles which evolved and grew in diameter during two successive pregnancies but had no changes in the intervening time period.",

This study sought to investigate associations between the SDOH and CVH of adult cancer survivors. Data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (2013-2017) were used. Participants reporting a history of cancer were included, excluding those with only nonmelanotic skin cancer, or with missing data for any domain of SDOH or CVH. SDOH was quantified with a 6-domain, 38-item score, consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations (higher score indicated worse deprivation). CVH was quantified based on the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8, but due to unavailable detailed dietary data, a 7-item CVH score was used, with a higher score indicating worse CVH. Survey-specific multivariable Poisson regression was used to test associations between SDOH quartiles and CVH. Altogether, 8,254 subjects were analyzed, representing a population of 10,887,989 persons. Worse SDOH was associated with worse CVH (highest vs lowest quartile: risk ratio 1.30; 95% CI: 1.25-1.35; P\u00a0< 0.001), with a grossly linear relationship between SDOH and CVH scores.

        "AbstractText": "Gap junctions transmit electrical signals in neurons and serve metabolic coupling and chemical communication. Gap junctions are made of intercellular channels with large pores, allowing ions and small molecules to permeate. In the mammalian retina, intercellular coupling fulfills many vital functions in visual signal processing but is also implicated in promoting cell death after insults, such as excitotoxicity or hypoxia. Conversely, some studies also suggested a role for retinal gap junctions in neuroprotection. Recently, gap junctions were also advocated as conduits for therapeutic drug delivery in neurodegenerative disorders. This requires the permeation of rather large molecules through retinal gap junctions. However, the permeability of retinal networks for molecules >0.6 kDa has not been tested systematically. Here, we used the cut-loading method and probed gap junctional networks in the mouse retina for their permeability to cGMP and cAMP coupled to Biotin, using the well-characterized tracer Neurobiotin as control. Biotin-cGMP and -cAMP have a molecular weight of >0.8 kDa. We show that they cannot pass the gap junctions of horizontal cells but can permeate through the gap junctions of specific amacrine cells in the inner retina. These amacrine cells do not comprise AII amacrine cells and nitric oxide-releasing amacrine cells but some unknown type. In summary, we show that some retinal gap junctions are large enough to let molecules >0.8 kDa pass, making the intercellular delivery of therapeutic agents - already successfully exploited, for example, in cancer - also feasible in neurodegenerative diseases.",

We also reviewed the most current literature and phenotypes associated with reported pediatric cases of autoimmune retinopathy. The design of the study was a case report, with a retrospective case series literature review. This study incorporated data from six subjects, with one presenting as an original case report and five being identified from the English-language literature published to date. The materials and methods involved a descriptive analysis of fundus findings, electrophysiologic testing, serum autoantibody testing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), brain MRI scanning, and fluorescein angiography, which were performed where available. The study evaluated the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of all subjects and followed their visual function over time. All six subjects had retinal abnormalities that were documented on imaging, while five out of the six subjects had optic nerve abnormalities. Electrophysiologic testing was performed on three subjects, all of whom recorded abnormal results. An underlying neoplastic disorder was described for four subjects. Serum autoantibody testing results were available for four subjects. The serum testing included using antibodies against a 22-kDa antigen, a 35-kDa optic nerve-derived antigen, a 62-kDa antigen, enolase, recoverin, tubulin, and pyruvate kinase M2. Our subject presented 12 years after resection of a ganglioglioma with asymmetric bilateral vision loss, disc edema in one eye, advanced disc pallor in the fellow eye, and bilateral subtle retinal infiltrates, despite having a normal fluorescein angiogram. OCT demonstrated asymmetric ganglion cell layer thinning, which is consistent with the vision loss. Our subject also had abnormal brain MRI findings of widespread pachymeningeal enhancement, but he had a normal cerebrospinal fluid composition. He was initially treated with high-dose pulse steroids, followed by intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. He experienced partial visual recovery in both eyes. Pediatric autoimmune retinopathy and optic neuropathy are rare diseases that can present with unique signs and symptoms. In pediatric patients who present with symptoms of subacute progressive vision loss with negative inflammatory workups, a history of prior neoplasm, and/or clinical findings of progressive retinopathy or optic neuropathy, an autoimmune process should be considered in the differential.",

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and WanFangData were searched for studies published up to March 10, 2023; a random-effects model (RCT) and a fixed-effect model were used to evaluate the safety. Operative time, length of extraction skin incision, overall complications, superficial wound infection, organ/space surgical site infection and incisional hernia were evaluated. A total of 5 studies were included in this research. There were no significant advantages in operation time, length of the incision, overall complications, superficial wound infection and organ/space surgical site in the Pfannenstiel group compared to the no Pfannenstiel group. However, the Pfannenstiel incision has a tendency to increase the length of the incision (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.22 to 0.33; p = 0.71) and the results of the remaining five (operative time,overall complications,incisional hernia, incisional infection and organ/space surgical site infection) are slightly skewed toward the Pfannenstiel incision.

We tried to analyze the expression of those three proteins while building a predictor scoring system to predict the ovarian cancer chemoresistance from the ovarian cancer tissue immunohistochemistry. We conducted a cohort study of 64 patients divided into two groups (32 patients in each group) at the Cipto Mangunkusumo, Tarakan, Dharmais, and Fatmawati Hospital\u00a0which are located in Jakarta city, Indonesia. The patients underwent cytoreductive debulking and histopathological examination continued by six series of chemotherapy followed by six months of observation.

Ovarian cancer tissue immunohistochemistry tests were then performed to count the CSCs, RAD6 and DDB2 expressions. We found relationship between increased CSCs, RAD6 and reduced DDB2 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) expression in ovarian cancer tissue with the chemoresistance. A possible predictor scoring system named IHC-UNEDO scoring was built to aid the ovarian cancer chemoresistance prediction.

        "AbstractText": "Lung cancer ranks the top of malignancies that cause cancer-related deaths worldwide. The leaves of Morus alba L are traditional Chinese medicine widely applied in respiratory diseases. Our previous work has demonstrated the anti-lung cancer effect of secondary metabolites of mulberry leaf, but their mechanism of action has still not fully elucidated. We synthesized Moracin N (MAN)-Probe conjugated with alkyne to label lung cancer cells and identified protein targets by chemical proteomic analysis. MAN and its probe exerted similar growth-inhibitory effect on human lung cancer cells. Chemical proteomic results showed that MAN targeted the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) checkpoint pathway and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, indicating its immune-regulatory function. Cell-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) results showed the direct interaction of MAN with PD-L1 protein. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that MAN bound to E158 residue of PD-L1 protein. MAN downregulated the expression levels of PD-L1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and disrupted the PD-L1/programmed death 1 (PD-1) binding, including other secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves Guangsangon E (GSE) and Chalcomoracin (CMR). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-cultured with MAN-treated A549\u00a0cells, resulting in the increase of CD8+ GZMB+ T cells and the decrease of CD8+ PD-1+ T cells. It suggested that MAN exerts anti-cancer effect through blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. In\u00a0vivo, MAN combined with anti-PD-1 antibody significantly inhibited lung cancer development and metastasis, indicating their synergistic effect. Taken together, secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves target the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling, enhance T cell-mediated immunity and inhibit the tumorigenesis of lung cancer.

This study determined the knowledge, perception, and screening practices on cervical cancer among female nurses and midwives in the Central Region of Ghana. A quantitative descriptive cross-sectional survey amongst nurses and midwives was used for the study. A convenience sampling technique was applied to yield a representative sample of 130 female nurses and midwives working in Our Lady of Grace Hospital in the Central Region, Ghana. Data was collected from the participants using a self-administered questionnaire. The data was analysed using SPSS version 20, and standard descriptive statistics such as proportions were used to summarize the survey data. Almost all the nurses (99%) had heard of cervical cancer. Majority (97.1%) of the respondents believed cervical cancer is preventable however, 67.6% also believed that it is incurable. Almost half (42.2%) of the respondents did not perceive themselves as at risk of cervical cancer. Thus, only 11.8% of the nurses had ever screened for cervical cancer. However, majority (92.2%) were willing to recommend the screening to others. The respondents of this study had some knowledge of cervical cancer however had low patronage for recommended screening practices.

We attempted to investigate CD10 (Cluster of differentiation 10) and EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) expression in BPT in order to highlight their diagnostic and prognostic values. Eight patients with BPT are recruited from January 2014 to December 2020 and immunohistochemical assessment of CD10 and EGFR is realized. Median age was 27\u00b115.2, the mean tumor size was 9.63\u00b110.21. Only malignant tumours showed expression for EGFR. Borderline and malignant tumors were CD10 positive. Patients overexpressing CD10 were postmenopausal with great tumor size, 25% of these were sarcomatous. Coexistence of CD10 and EGFR overexpression was found in 25% of cases and was associated with age (P=0.008), tumor size (P=0.030) and hitologic types (P=0.014).

        "AbstractText": "Automated segmentation of multiple organs and tumors from 3D medical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans using deep learning methods can aid in diagnosing and treating cancer. However, organs often overlap and are complexly connected, characterized by extensive anatomical variation and low contrast. In addition, the diversity of tumor shape, location, and appearance, coupled with the dominance of background voxels, makes accurate 3D medical image segmentation difficult. In this paper, a novel 3D large-kernel (LK) attention module is proposed to address these problems to achieve accurate multi-organ segmentation and tumor segmentation. The advantages of biologically inspired self-attention and convolution are combined in the proposed LK attention module, including local contextual information, long-range dependencies, and channel adaptation. The module also decomposes the LK convolution to optimize the computational cost and can be easily incorporated into CNNs such as U-Net. Comprehensive ablation experiments demonstrated the feasibility of convolutional decomposition and explored the most efficient and effective network design. Among them, the best Mid-type 3D LK attention-based U-Net network was evaluated on CT-ORG and BraTS 2020 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance when compared to avant-garde CNN and Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation. The performance improvement due to the proposed 3D LK attention module was statistically validated.",

        "ArticleTitle": "KIDNEY CANCER IN CROATIA - TRENDS IN INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY IN THE 21",
        "AbstractText": "Kidney cancer is estimated to be responsible for more than 400 000 new cancer cases and 180 000 cancer deaths a year. Its incidence is increasing in the majority of developed countries, due to an increased prevalence of recognized risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use and obesity, as well as incidental findings on unrelated diagnostic imaging procedures. Mortality is decreasing in the majority of European countries, due to improvements in treatment and stage at diagnosis shift with more tumors being diagnosed at an early stage. In this paper, we present kidney cancer incidence and mortality trends in Croatia using joinpoint regression analysis. The incidence was rising throughout the 2001-2019 period, with an annual percent change (APC) of 2.5%; more so in men (APC of 2.5%) than in women (APC of 2.2%). Mortality increased during the 2001-2014 period (APC of 2.4%), but started to decrease in recent years (APC -2.7%, 2014-2020). Unlike sex differences observed in other European countries, with more favorable mortality trends found in women, our study showed a constant increase in mortality in women (APC of 1.2%) and a recent decrease in mortality in men, starting in 2013 (APC of -2.8%), after a period of increase from 2001 (APC of 3.3%).",

        "AbstractText": "The objective of this study was to analyze, in a randomized controlled multicenter trial, whether a xenogeneic collagen matrix (XCM) could be used to cover skin defects. Patients with the need for skin excisions were recruited and randomized to treatment with a skin graft after a period of granulation or to treatment with an XCM. The results were evaluated by two independent observers on the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. On this scale, scars are ranked from 1 to 10 in six different categories. Results range from 6 to 60, with lower scores representing scars closer to normal skin. The results 6 months after reconstruction were used as primary endpoint and compared in a non-inferiority approach. A total of 39 wounds in the head and neck region were analyzed. The mean results were 16.55 (standard deviation 6.8) for XCM and 16.83 (standard deviation 8.21) in the control group. The result of the XCM was not significantly inferior to the result of the skin graft (p\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Within the limitations of the study, it seems that the use of xenogeneic collagen matrices is a viable alternative to other approaches in small skin defects, and therefore should be taken into account whenever the reduction of patient morbidity to a minimum is the priority.

        "AbstractText": "Protein kinases regulate various cellular functions and hold significant pharmacological promise in cancer and other diseases. Although kinase inhibitors are one of the largest groups of approved drugs, much of the human kinome remains unexplored but potentially druggable. Computational approaches, such as machine learning, offer efficient solutions for exploring kinase-compound interactions and uncovering novel binding activities. Despite the increasing availability of three-dimensional (3D) protein and compound structures, existing methods predominantly focus on exploiting local features from one-dimensional protein sequences and two-dimensional molecular graphs to predict binding affinities, overlooking the 3D nature of the binding process. Here we present KDBNet, a deep learning algorithm that incorporates 3D protein and molecule structure data to predict binding affinities. KDBNet uses graph neural networks to learn structure representations of protein binding pockets and drug molecules, capturing the geometric and spatial characteristics of binding activity. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to quantify and calibrate the uncertainties of KDBNet's predictions, enhancing its utility in model-guided discovery in chemical or protein space. Experiments demonstrated that KDBNet outperforms existing deep learning models in predicting kinase-drug binding affinities. The uncertainties estimated by KDBNet are informative and well-calibrated with respect to prediction errors. When integrated with a Bayesian optimization framework, KDBNet enables data-efficient active learning and accelerates the exploration and exploitation of diverse high-binding kinase-drug pairs.",

To our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating the outcomes of laryngectomy in patients aged over 75 years, which prompted us to present this unique series. Methods We reviewed departmental records at the University College Hospital,\u00a0London over a 10-year period, and identified a total of 18 patients over the age of 75 years who underwent total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the demographic, clinical, and histopathologic features and outcomes for each patient. Results The age of the cohort ranged from 75 to 90 years, with a mean age of 79.8 years. All patients had a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score of 3 or more (due to age), with a mean of 4.7, and a maximum score of 8 for two patients. Length of inpatient stay varied significantly, ranging from 20 to 149 days, with a mean of 46 days. We identified 14 patients who underwent laryngectomy prior to September 2017, in whom the five-year survival was 21.4%. The three-year survival rate for all patients was 22.2%. In bivariate analysis, advanced age at surgery\u00a0positively correlated with increased length of hospital admission and increased incidence of complications, although these results were not statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusions Our study highlights the significance of the impact of age and comorbidities on postoperative outcomes and sheds light on the unique challenges faced by an ageing population.

This study aimed at determining the rate of non-diagnosis in suspected lesions and reviewing the management challenges of ovarian tumours highly suspicious for malignancy in our hospital. A three-year retrospective review of patients' records from the ward, clinic, theatre, and histopathology laboratory was carried out. Cases with high indices of suspicion for ovarian cancer (ovarian tumour with malignant radiologic features with any of ascites, pleural effusion, as well as cachexia, anaemia, or evidence of metastasis) were included. In-depth interviews were carried out with a consultant from each specialty of Radiology, Radio-oncology, Pathology, and Gynaecologic oncology at the gynaecologic oncology multidisciplinary team meeting. One hundred and twenty-two cases of highly suspicious ovarian malignancies were seen with a mean age of 40.6 years. Of these, 28 (23%) had surgery and 77% did not have any form of histological diagnosis. Of those that had surgery, 13 (46.4%) had upfront surgery and 15 (53.6%) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). Only two cases had documented complete (R0) debulking. Among those that had upfront surgery, one case (7.7%) was an ovarian fibroid and one (7.7%) was a fibrosarcoma while two cases (15.4%) were borderline ovarian tumours. Chemotherapy was commenced based on malignant cells on ascitic or pleural fluid cytology in three cases. Of all the malignant cases, epithelial carcinomas were commonest accounting for 48%. Aside from the general late presentation of cases, insufficient funds for treatment, poor coverage of health insurance for cancer care, unavailability of routine immunohistochemistry, lack of germline and somatic testing, non-availability or prohibitive cost of some chemotherapeutic agents, unavailability of maintenance therapies, inadequate capacity to manage toxicities, inadequate skill across all specialties, unavailability / erratic function of computerized tomography scans and unavailable positron emission tomography, lack of interventional radiology facility amongst others were all identified as challenges to management. Most patients with tumours highly suspicious for ovarian cancers did not get a histologic diagnosis and probably died undiagnosed.

We used qualitative analysis to better understand the intersection between cultural identity, the experience of sexual dysfunction as a side-effect of pelvic radiotherapy, and willingness to communicate about sexual dysfunction with healthcare providers, in Cuban American women in Miami, Florida. Doing so, we found four unique themes among Cuban American participants regarding the intersection of national identity, Hispanic identity, Catholic religion, and their experience of radiotherapy-related sexual dysfunction: Marianismo, Machismo, Familismo, and Espiritismo. These themes, a reflection of the cohort's shared identity, were found to have an effect on participant views of sexual health, romantic relationships, coping strategies, and relative comfort discussing problems with intercourse. These cultural values served as barriers to openly discussing sexual dysfunction with not just medical providers and research teams but also their partners, families, and friends. In order to encourage Cuban American participation in sexual medicine studies, future research should evaluate strategies to overcome these barriers.",

        "AbstractText": "Flexible needle insertion procedures are common in minimally-invasive surgeries for diagnosing and treating prostate cancer. Bevel-tip needles provide physicians the capability to steer the needle during long insertions to avoid vital anatomical structures in the patient and reduce post-operative patient discomfort. To provide needle placement feedback to the physician, sensors are embedded into needles for determining the real-time 3D shape of the needle during operation without needing to visualize the needle intra-operatively. Through expansive research in fiber optics, a plethora of bio-compatible, MRI-compatible, optical shape-sensors have been developed to provide real-time shape feedback, such as single-core and multicore fiber Bragg gratings. In this paper, we directly compare single-core fiber-based and multicore fiber-based needle shape-sensing through similarly constructed, four-active area sensorized bevel-tip needles inserted into phantom and ex-vivo tissue on the same experimental platform. In this work, we found that for shape-sensing in phantom tissue, the two needles performed identically with a p-value of 0.164 > 0.05, but in ex-vivo real tissue, the single-core fiber sensorized needle significantly outperformed the multicore fiber configuration with a p-value of 0.0005 < 0.05. This paper also presents the experimental platform and method for directly comparing these optical shape sensors for the needle shape-sensing task, as well as provides direction, insight and required considerations for future work in constructively optimizing sensorized needles.",

From April 2015 to October 2022, we prospectively enrolled 331 patients with suspected PCNs in our prospective database. Among them, 112 patients chosen to receive surgical resection were included. Only 96 patients who underwent EUS-guided cystic fluid LBC were finally studied. The diagnostic values of LBC for differentiating benign and malignant PCNs and subtypes of PCNs were evaluated. There were 71 female and 25 male patients with a mean age of 47.6 \u00b1 14.4 years. The median cyst size was 43.4 mm. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of LBC for the differentiation of benign and malignant PCNs were 96.9%, 57.1%, 100%, 100%, and 96.7%, respectively. The overall diagnostic accuracy of LBC for specific cyst types was 33.3% (32/96). Cysts located in the pancreatic body/tail or with irregular shapes were more likely to obtain a definite LBC diagnosis. At the same time, age, sex, tumor size, cystic fluid viscosity, operation time, needle type, and presence of septation were not significantly different. Liquid-based cytology alone is useful for differentiating benign PCNs from malignant PCNs and can successfully characterize the PCN subtypes in one-third of patients.

        "AbstractText": "The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting BCR-ABL has drastically changed the treatment approach of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), greatly prolonged the life of CML patients, and improved their prognosis. However, TKI resistance is still a major problem with CML patients, reducing the efficacy of treatment and their quality of life. TKI resistance is mainly divided into BCR-ABL-dependent and BCR-ABL-independent resistance. Now, the main clinical strategy addressing TKI resistance is to switch to newly developed TKIs. However, data have shown that these new drugs may cause serious adverse reactions and intolerance and cannot address all resistance mutations. Therefore, finding new therapeutic targets to overcome TKI resistance is crucial and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has emerged as a focus. The UPS mediates the degradation of most proteins in organisms and controls a wide range of physiological processes. In recent years, the study of UPS in hematological malignant tumors has resulted in effective treatments, such as bortezomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In CML, the components of UPS cooperate or antagonize the efficacy of TKI by directly or indirectly affecting the ubiquitination of BCR-ABL, interfering with CML-related signaling pathways, and negatively or positively affecting leukemia stem cells. Some of these molecules may help overcome TKI resistance and treat CML. In this review, the mechanism of TKI resistance is briefly described, the components of UPS are introduced, existing studies on UPS participating in TKI resistance are listed, and UPS as the therapeutic target and strategies are discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "Bronchoscopy is currently the least invasive method for definitively diagnosing lung cancer, which kills more people in the United States than any other form of cancer. Successfully diagnosing suspicious lung nodules requires accurate localization of the bronchoscope relative to a planned biopsy site in the airways. This task is challenging because the lung deforms intraoperatively due to respiratory motion, the airways lack photometric features, and the anatomy's appearance is repetitive. In this paper, we introduce a real-time camera-based method for accurately localizing a bronchoscope with respect to a planned needle insertion pose. Our approach uses deep learning and accounts for deformations and overcomes limitations of global pose estimation by estimating pose relative to anatomical landmarks. Specifically, our learned model considers airway bifurcations along the airway wall as landmarks because they are distinct geometric features that do not vary significantly with respiratory motion. We evaluate our method in a simulated dataset of lungs undergoing respiratory motion. The results show that our method generalizes across patients and localizes the bronchoscope with accuracy sufficient to access the smallest clinically-relevant nodules across all levels of respiratory deformation, even in challenging distal airways. Our method could enable physicians to perform more accurate biopsies and serve as a key building block toward accurate autonomous robotic bronchoscopy.",

The therapeutic value of adding immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy for SCLC is low, and only a few SCLC patients have shown a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are tumor cells shed from solid tumor masses into the peripheral circulation and are key to tumor metastasis. Single-cell sequencing has revealed that the genetic profiles of individual CTCs are highly heterogeneous and contribute to the poor outcome and prognosis of SCLC patients. Theoretically, phenotypic analysis of CTCs may be able to predict the diagnostic significance of new potential targets for metastatic tumors.

The results of this study also allowed us to draw insight into our feature pool and identify the features that could have the most utility in the context of developing an efficient ML classifier. While a model trained on our entire feature pool of 29 features significantly outperformed the traditionally used clinical scoring system, we were able to achieve an equivalent performance using a subset of only 15 features through strategic feature selection methods.

Enriching grafted tissue with ADSC-EVs may improve retention rates by modulating macrophages resident within both the breast and lipoaspirate. We aimed to identify key macrophage phenotypes that are modulated by ADSC-EVs in vitro. ADSCs were isolated from lipoaspirates of women undergoing AFG and characterised by flow cytometry and differentiation potential. ADSC-EVs were isolated from culture media and characterised by tuneable resistive pulse sensing, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot. Primary monocyte-derived macrophages were polarized to an M1-like (GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3), M2-like phenotype (M-CSF, IL-4) or maintained (M0-like; M-CSF) and ADSC-EVs were co-cultured with macrophages for 48 h.

Both runs were analysed to examine the prevalence of each cluster, representing a unique macrophage phenotype, with and without ADSC-EVs.

However, the cardiovascular impact of CR-modeled interventions has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a multidisciplinary model of CR reduces cardiotoxicity and improves cardiovascular risk in patients undergoing breast cancer treatment. We randomly assigned patients with stage I to III breast cancer scheduled to receive anthracycline and/or trastuzumab-based chemotherapy to the CR intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a037) or usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a037). The intervention included guideline-directed management of cardiovascular risk factors, dietary counselling, and supervised exercise for 52\u00a0weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and serum biomarkers were acquired at baseline and 52\u00a0weeks. There was no difference in the primary outcome, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), between groups at 52\u00a0weeks (61%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%). Other markers of cardiotoxicity, including high-sensitivity troponin I and brain natriuretic peptide, were similar between groups. However, total cholesterol (5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 mmol/L to 4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0mmol/L, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and low-density lipoprotein (3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 mmol/L to 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0mmol/L, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) decreased in the intervention group at 52\u00a0weeks and were unchanged in usual care. In all patients, adverse cardiac and metabolic changes occurred over 52\u00a0weeks including reductions in LVEF, left ventricular mass, high-density lipoprotein, lean body mass, insulin-like growth factor-1, as well as increased triglycerides, whole-body and truncal fat mass (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.050). The CR-modeled intervention had no effect on LVEF or biomarkers of cardiotoxicity.

Cell state is the product of the combinatorial effect of individual factors operating within a coordinated regulatory network. Here, we discuss the contribution of both gene regulatory and splicing regulatory networks in defining stem cell fate during differentiation and the critical role of protein isoforms in this process. We review recent experimental and computational approaches that characterize gene regulatory networks, splice regulatory networks, and the resulting transcriptome and proteome they mediate during differentiation. Such approaches include long-read RNA sequencing, which has demonstrated high-resolution profiling of mRNA isoforms, and Cas13-based CRISPR, which could make possible high-throughput isoform screening. Collectively, these developments enable systems-level profiling of factors contributing to cell state. Overall, gene and splice regulatory networks are important in defining cell state. The emerging high-throughput systems-level approaches will characterize the gene regulatory network components necessary in driving stem cell differentiation.",

The relationship between both PTSS and PTG is not clear in CC survivors. Assessing challenges to core beliefs and rumination could give information regarding the different paths that lead to traumatic responses. Thus, this study aims to identify childhood cancer survivors' profiles from PTSS and PTG measures and to examine the pathways of relationships between PTSS and PTG, rumination, and challenge to core belief. Sixty-two CC survivors completed surveys on their childhood cancer experience, PTSS, PTG, challenge to core beliefs, and rumination. High PTG scores among childhood cancer survivors (Cluster 1), High PTSS scores among childhood cancer survivors (Cluster 2), and Childhood cancer survivors without changes (Cluster 3). Network analysis found that the challenge to core beliefs is the central point in the relationship between the variables, in a direct and positive relationship with PTG. We found an indirect path from challenge to core beliefs to PTSS, mediated by intrusive and deliberative ruminations. The combined findings suggested that there are different profiles related to trauma in CC survivors and the relationship between PTSS and PTG is mediated by the challenge to core beliefs and deliberative and intrusive rumination.",

Using this EV production method, combined with proteomic profiling, we show that PC3 tumoroids secrete EVs with previously undefined protein cargo. Intriguingly, an increase in EV amounts and extensive changes in the EV protein composition were detected upon invasive transition of the tumoroids. The changes in EV protein cargo were counteracted by chemical inhibition of invasion. These results reveal the impact of the tumoroids' invasive status on EV secretion and cargo, and highlight the necessity of in vivo-mimicking conditions for uncovering novel cancer-derived EV components.",

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a new single-step extraction method, called miRQuick, for efficient and high-recovery extraction of EV-miRNAs from samples. The miRQuick method involves adding positively charged substances to the sample, causing negatively charged EVs to quickly aggregate and precipitate. A membrane lysate is then added to extract only miRNA. The entire process can be completed within an hour using standard laboratory equipment. We validated the miRQuick method using various analytical techniques and compared its performance to other methods for plasma, urine and saliva samples. The miRQuick method demonstrated significantly higher performance than other methods, not only for blood plasma but also for urine and saliva samples. Furthermore, we successfully extracted and detected nine biomarker candidate miRNAs in the plasma of breast cancer patients using miRQuick.

To activate normal human fibroblasts, liquid overlay technique or nemosis was used and \u03b1-SMA protein expression, CAFs marker, in fibroblastic spheroids was measured by blotting. The luminal A, MCF-7, and luminal B, MDA-MB 361, cell lines were treated with normal and spheroidal/activated fibroblast conditioned medium for 48 hours. The morphological changes of both luminal A and B cells were evaluated by invert light microscopy and analyzed through the shape factor formula. Moreover, chemo-sensitivity, proliferation, and changes in ER-related and proliferative genes expression levels were assessed respectively via MTT assay, Ki67 expression Immunofluorescence assay, real time PCR and Annexin V-FITC techniques. Activated (spheroidal) fibroblasts, expressed \u03b1SMA marker two folds more than monolayer cultured fibroblasts. Our study indicated a significant increase in IC50 of both luminal A and B cell lines after being treated with conditioned medium particularly in treated group with spheroidal conditioned medium. Studying Morphological changes using shape factor formula demonstrated more aggressiveness with gaining mesenchymal features in both luminal A and B subtypes by increasing exposure time. Changes in the expression of Ki67 were observed following treatment with fibroblastic and spheroidal paracrine secretome. Driven Data from Ki67 assay supports the luminal A and B interconversion by elevated Ki67 expression in luminal A and lowered Ki67 expression in luminal B. Gene expression analysis revealed that anti-apoptotic Bcl2 gene expression in both luminal types treated with condition medium has been increased though there has seen no interchange in expression of ER-related and proliferative genes between luminal A (MCF7) and luminal B (MDA-MB361) subtypes, the results of Annexin V-FITC flow cytometry test indicated a decrease in the population of both early and late apoptotic cells in groups treated with both fibroblastic and spheroidal condition medium compared to of control group. Under the paracrine influence of fibroblast cells, both luminal A (MCF7) and luminal B (MDA-MB) subtypes of breast cancer gained invasive, anti-apoptotic, and chemoresistance features which are mostly increased by activated(spheroidal) fibroblasts conditioned medium mimicking CAFs.

These two miRNAs regulate numerous cellular processes, such as proliferation and migration. This research was intended to explore the simultaneous replacement effect of miR-143, and miR-145 on in vitro tumorgenicity of U87 glioblastoma cells. U87 cells were cultured, and transfected with miR-143-5p and miR-145-5p. Afterward, the changes in cell viability, and apoptosis induction were determined by MTT assay and Annexin V/PI staining. The accumulation of cells at the cell cycle phases was assessed using the flow cytometry. Wound healing and colony formation assays were performed to study cell migration. qRT-PCR and western blot techniques were utilized to quantify gene expression levels. Our results showed that miR-143-5p and 145-5p exogenous upregulation cooperatively diminished cell viability, and enhanced U-87 cell apoptosis by modulating Caspase-3/8/9, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein expression. The combination therapy increased accumulation of cells at the sub-G1 phase by modulating CDK1, Cyclin D1, and P53 protein expression. miR-143/145-5p significantly decreased cell migration, and reduced colony formation ability by the downregulation of c-Myc and CD44 gene expression. Furthermore, the results showed the combination therapy of these miRNAs could remarkably downregulate phosphorylated-AKT expression levels. In conclusion, miR-143 and miR-145 were indicated to show cooperative anti- cancer effects on glioblastoma cells via modulating AKT signaling as a new therapeutic approach.",

We found that specific activation of TRPC3 increased Ca2+ signalling in SKOV3 cells and stimulated an immediate increase in EV release. Ca2+-stimulants histamine and ionomycin likewise induced EV release, and imaging analysis revealed distinct stimulation-dependent temporal and spatial release dynamics. Interestingly, inhibition of TRPC3 attenuated histamine-stimulated Ca2+-entry and EV release, indicating that TRPC3 is likely to act downstream of histamine signalling in EV biogenesis. Furthermore, we found that direct activation of TRPC3 as well as the application of EVs derived from TRPC3-activated cells increased SKOV3 proliferation.

The minimal treatments available for this aggressive type of leukemia has been an ongoing problem. Chromosomal translocations of the KMT2A gene are known as MLL, which expresses MLL fusion proteins. A protein called menin is an important oncogenic cofactor for these MLL fusion proteins, thus providing a new avenue for treatments against this subset of acute leukemias. In this study, we report results using the structure-based drug design (SBDD) approach to discover potential novel MLL-mediated leukemia inhibitors from natural products against menin. The three-dimensional (3D) protein model was derived from Protein Databank (Protein ID: 4GQ4), and EasyModeller 4.0 and I-TASSER were used to fix missing residues during rebuilding. Out of the ten protein models generated (five from EasyModeller and I-TASSER each), one model was selected. The selected model demonstrated the most reasonable quality and had 75.5% of residues in the most favored regions, 18.3% of residues in additionally allowed regions, 3.3% of residues in generously allowed regions, and 2.9% of residues in disallowed regions. A ligand library containing 25,131 ligands from a Chinese database was virtually screened using AutoDock Vina, in addition to three known menin inhibitors. The top 10 compounds including ZINC000103526876, ZINC000095913861, ZINC000095912705, ZINC000085530497, ZINC000095912718, ZINC000070451048, ZINC000085530488, ZINC000095912706, ZINC000103580868, and ZINC000103584057 had binding energies of -11.0, -10.7, -10.6, -10.2, -10.2, -9.9, -9.9, -9.9, -9.9, and -9.9 kcal/mol, respectively. To confirm the stability of the menin-ligand complexes and the binding mechanisms, molecular dynamics simulations including molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) computations were performed. The amino acid residues that were found to be potentially crucial in ligand binding included Phe243, Met283, Cys246, Tyr281, Ala247, Ser160, Asn287, Asp185, Ser183, Tyr328, Asn249, His186, Leu182, Ile248, and Pro250.

The compounds identified herein were found to have good pharmacological profiles and had negligible toxicity. Additionally, these compounds were predicted as antileukemic, antineoplastic, chemopreventive, and apoptotic agents. The 10 natural compounds can be further explored as potential novel agents for the effective treatment of MLL-mediated leukemia.",

However, the safe, efficient, and specific delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 components into cells and tissues remains a challenge. While many currently available delivery methods achieve high levels of gene editing effects in vivo, they often result in genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are cell-derived lipid nanoparticles, are capable of transferring protein and nucleic acid cargoes between cells, making them a promising endogenous alternative to synthetic delivery methods. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the currently available strategies for EV-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9. These strategies include cell-based, passive loading obtained by overexpression of CRISPR/Cas9, active loading involving protein or RNA dimerization, and loading into already purified EVs. All these approaches suggest that EV-based CRISPR/Cas9 delivery is useful for achieving both in vitro and in vivo gene editing. Despite that, substantial variations in cellular uptake and gene editing efficiencies indicate that further improvement and standardization are required for the therapeutic use of EVs as a CRISPR/Cas9 delivery vehicle. These improvements include, but is not limited to, the high-yield purification of EVs, increased loading and release efficiencies, as well as improved tissue- or cell-specific targeting specificities.",

The University of Rochester Medical Center Lymphoma Database was used to identify patients. The primary outcome was any AF episode identified using the International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision codes. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the risk of AF through the use of a time-dependent covariate for treatment overall as well as separate time-varying measures of BTKi (mainly ibrutinib) and non-BTKi treatment. The relative risk of all-cause mortality was determined using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Among 1,957 lymphoma patients, the rate of AF at 5-years following initiation of BTKi treatment was higher (25%) compared to those receiving non-BTKi therapy (8%), and those receiving no treatment (4%). Multivariable analysis showed that BTKi treatment was associated with pronounced increased risk for AF compared to no treatment (HR:\u00a05.07 [95% CI: 2.88-8.90; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001]).

The proportion of young women having PCOS as per the Rotterdam and European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (EHSRE) Criteria are reported. The study enrolled 308 girl medical students. More than one-tenth of the study participants (11.7%, 36/308) had confirmed PCOS (Rotterdam Criteria). As per the EHSRE criteria, 24/36 had classic PCOS, 11/36 had ovulatory phenotype, and 01/36 had the non-hyperandrogenic phenotype PCOS. USG was required in 123/308 (39%); of which 91 consented and 16/91 (18%) had conclusive PCOS. Twenty-three girls required laboratory investigations, of which two had abnormal values suggestive of PCOS. Irregular menses and hirsutism were significantly associated with the PCOS (P < 0.05). The proportion of young medical students with PCOS was 12%. Irregular menses and hirsutism were significantly associated with PCOS.",

        "AbstractText": "The risk of recurrence after nephrectomy for primary clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is estimated in daily practice solely based on clinical criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic relevance of common somatic mutations with respect to tumor aggressiveness and outcomes of ccRCC patients after definitive treatment. Primary tumors from 37 patients with ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy were analyzed for presence of somatic mutations using a 15-gene targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel. Associations to histopathologic characteristics and outcomes were investigated in the study cohort (n=37) and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cohort (n=451). VHL was the most frequently mutated gene (51%), followed by PBRM1 (27%), BAP1 (13%), SETD2 (13%), KDM5C (5%), ATM (5%), MTOR (5%), and PTEN (3%). One-third of patients did not have any somatic mutations within the 15-gene panel. The vast majority of tumors harboring no mutations at all or VHL-only mutations (51%) were more frequently of smaller size (pT1-2) and earlier stage (I/II), whereas presence of any other gene mutations in various combinations with or without VHL was enriched in larger (pT3) and higher stage tumors (III) (p=0.02). No recurrences were noted in patients with unmutated tumors or VHL-only mutations as opposed to three relapses in patients with non- VHL somatic mutations (p=0.06). Presence of somatic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, or PTEN genes in 451 TCGA ccRCC patients was associated with a significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) compared to those with unaltered tumors (q=0.01). Preliminary findings from this ongoing study support the prognostic value of non- VHL mutations including PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2, KDM5C, ATM, MTOR, and PTEN in primary ccRCC tumors as surrogates of earlier recurrence and potential selection for adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition.",

Previous studies have focused primarily on tumor-associated protein-coding genes such as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, as well as their associated oncogenic pathways. However, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), rising stars in diverse physiological and pathological processes, have recently emerged as additional modulators in tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on two typical kinds of ncRNAs: long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). We describe the molecular patterns of ncRNAs and focus on the roles of ncRNAs in cancer stem cells (CSCs), tumor cells, and tumor environmental cells. CSCs are a small subset of tumor cells and are generally considered to be cells that initiate tumorigenesis, and dozens of ncRNAs have been defined as critical modulators in CSC maintenance and oncogenesis. Moreover, ncRNAs are widely involved in oncogenetic processes, including sustaining proliferation, resisting cell death, genome instability, metabolic disorders, immune escape and metastasis. We also discuss the potential applications of ncRNAs in tumor diagnosis and therapy. The progress in ncRNA research greatly improves our understanding of ncRNAs in oncogenesis and provides new potential targets for future tumor therapy.",

Studies have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is one of the major transmission routes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Pathogenic microorganisms such as SARS-CoV-2 can survive in the air and cause widespread infection among people. Early monitoring of pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere and accurate epidemic prediction are the frontier guarantee for preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. Monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms in the air, especially in densely populated areas, may raise the possibility to detect viruses before people are widely infected and contain the epidemic at an earlier stage. The multi-scale coupled accurate epidemic prediction system can provide support for governments to analyze the epidemic situation, allocate health resources, and formulate epidemic response policies. This review first elaborates on the effects of the atmospheric environment on pathogenic microorganism transmission, which lays a theoretical foundation for the monitoring and prediction of epidemic development. Secondly, the monitoring technique development and the necessity of monitoring pathogenic microorganisms in the atmosphere are summarized and emphasized. Subsequently, this review introduces the major epidemic prediction methods and highlights the significance to realize a multi-scale coupled epidemic prediction system by strengthening the multidisciplinary cooperation of epidemiology, atmospheric sciences, environmental sciences, sociology, demography, etc. By summarizing the achievements and challenges in monitoring and prediction of pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere, this review proposes suggestions for epidemic response, namely, the establishment of an integrated monitoring and prediction platform for pathogenic microorganism transmission in the atmosphere.",

The occurrence of abnormal chloride levels is frequently observed in critically ill patients, yet its clinical significance remains subject to debate. This study endeavors to explore the relationship between serum chloride levels and in-hospital mortality among patients affected by both congestive heart failure and diabetes. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on adult patients in the United States. The impact of serum chloride levels upon ICU admission on in-hospital mortality was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models, generalized additive models and subgroup analysis. The study encompassed 7,063 patients with coexisting diabetes and congestive heart failure. The fully adjusted model revealed an inverse association between serum chloride levels and in-hospital mortality. As a tertile variable (Q3 vs Q1), the odds ratio (OR) was 0.73 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.54-0.98 (p\u2009=\u20090.039). As a continuous variable, per 1\u00a0mmol/L increment, the OR (95% CI) was 0.97 (0.96-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.01). The relationship between serum chloride and in-hospital mortality demonstrated linearity (non-linear p\u2009=\u20090.958). Stratified analyses further validated the robustness of this correlation. Serum chloride levels exhibited a negative association with in-hospital mortality in patients with both congestive heart failure and diabetes.

To provide a more comprehensive analysis, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compile data from various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of acarbose intake on fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in adults. To identify relevant literature up to April 2023, a comprehensive search was conducted on various scholarly databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The effect size of the studies was evaluated using a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and I2. This systematic review and meta-analysis included a total of 101 RCTs with a total of 107 effect sizes. The effect sizes for FBS in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl), insulin in picomoles per liter (pmol/l), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) in percentage (%), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were 92, 46, 80, and 22, respectively. The pooled analysis indicated that acarbose intake resulted in significant decreases in FBS (p\u2009=\u20090.018), insulin (p\u2009<\u20090.001), HbA1c (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and HOMA-IR (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that acarbose intake can potentially lead to significant improvements in glycemic parameters by decreasing the levels of FBS, HbA1c, and insulin. However, larger and more rigorously designed studies are still needed to further evaluate and strengthen this association.",

The characterization of isolated exosomes and their internalization into MCF-7 cells was evaluated. The treatment of MCF-7 cells with exosomes isolated from different groups was done. Migration, the activity of MMP-2, mRNA expression of Bax and Bcl-2, protein expression of p-53 and Thr55 p-p53, and apoptosis were assessed. Isolated exosomes from unhealthy obese individuals increase MCF-7 cell migration. Regarding MMP activities, unhealthy normal weight and overweight and healthy obese groups isolated exosomes increase the MMP-2 activity than the treated group with exosomes isolated from counterpart groups. Furthermore, unhealthy normal weight and overweight and healthy obese obtained exosomes decrease apoptosis compared to counterpart groups. Altogether, plasma exosomes derived from both unhealthy individuals with normal weight and overweight status, as well as those with unhealthy obesity, negatively impacted the behavior of estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer cells.

        "AbstractText": "Two decades after the Rotterdam 2003 consensus workshop, there have been considerable advances in elucidating the pathophysiology and epidemiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This has prompted the re-examination of the features that characterise this common condition. Current definitions have led to great heterogeneity in the prevalence of PCOS and have contributed to inconsistent treatment protocols and assessment of therapeutic outcomes. Diagnosis is further complicated by the lack of universal agreement on threshold cut-offs for ovarian dysfunction and ethnic differences in hirsutism; both of which are key features in the definitions that are commonly used currently. These challenges often result in dissatisfaction with medical care among PCOS patients and their physicians. Our factor analysis mathematically identified anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), associated polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) and serum testosterone as the only significant cluster associated with menstrual cycle length variability. As such, we propose a simplified criteria wherein the presence of at least 2 of the 3 features below would be sufficient to define PCOS: (1) chronic oligo-ovulation or anovulation as indicated by oligomenorrhea (cycle lengths >35 days) or amenorrhea; (2) PCOM: raised AMH \u226537.0 pmol/L instead of transvaginal ultrasound assessment of ovaries; and (3) Androgen excess, or raised serum androgens above the laboratory reference for women.

Following the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis with appropriate tissue biopsies, prompt treatment with a bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone-based first-line induction with or without daratumumab should be initiated. The goal of treatment is to achieve the best haematologic response possible, ideally with involved free light chain <20 mg/L, as it offers the best chance of organ function improvement. Treatment should be changed if patients do not achieve a partial response within 2 cycles of treatment or very good partial response after 4 cycles or after autologous stem cell transplant, as achievement of profound and prolonged clonal responses translates to better organ response and long-term outcomes.

The following five themes emerged: (1) Under personal transition: nursing assessment, symptoms management, patient education, resources offered, refusing label of cancer survivors, promoting adjustment to a new normal life, promoting return to work, and recognizing meaning of survivorship; (2) Under cancer survivor's care transition: promoting self-care management, communication, and maximal recovery of body functions; (3) Under nurse's positive experience promoting delivery of quality cancer care: caring for cancer survivors, experience and knowledge, and advocate for cancer survivors; (4) Under barriers that negatively affected delivery of cancer care: low socioeconomic status (especially low income), cultures and languages barriers, and limited time providing nursing care; and (5) Suggestions to improve cancer care: establishing a new position - primary nurse, increasing the number of healthcare professionals, and improving knowledge, skills, and experience. Oncology nurses' knowledge and experience provide a good foundation for quality cancer care and contribute to the health and wellbeing of cancer survivors.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Cancer information-seeking profiles: A self-report measure of patients' distinct preferences for information about their cancer.",
        "AbstractText": "Contemporary cancer care approaches, such as value- and strengths-based health care, involve integrating patients' needs and preferences, as the cancer experience unfolds. Distinct cancer information-seeking behaviours among patients are increasingly found to influence patient-provider communication, treatment-related decision-making, health processes and outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction with cancer care services. My program of research has already documented diverse cancer information-seeking profiles (CISP) among patients. These profiles can easily be captured by a theory-driven and empirically sound self-report single-item measure presented herein. Guided by Self-Evaluation Theory (SET) - which posits that individuals vary in their motivation to seek information about the self - quantitative work established that SET motives could be reproduced in health-related contexts (N = 600). Qualitative inquiry subsequently explored information-seeking among individuals with various cancer diagnoses. Based on this series of studies, a CIPS measure (containing a general question which prompts individuals to choose the most representative statement based on five descriptions of distinct informational profiles) was tested in a large sample of individuals with diverse cancers. In this latter sample (N = 2,142), patients were administered the CISP and the Ambulatory Oncology Patient Satisfaction Survey (AOPSS). The most frequently reported CISP was complementary (50.2%, i.e., search for cancer information that added to what patients already knew), followed by minimal (25.2%, i.e., no search for cancer information), then guarded (14.4%, i.e., avoiding negative and only seeking hopeful cancer information), peer-focused (6.4%, i.e., search for cancer information from similar others), and last, intense (3.8%, i.e., seeking as much cancer information as possible). These profiles were also differentially related to care satisfaction with intense profiles being the least satisfied across all cancer care domains. The CISP measure can readily assess patients' profiles in the search for (or avoidance of) information about their cancer so that more personalized interventions can be provided. Future research exploring how CISP evolves, as the cancer experience unfolds, is also worthy of further study.",

The worldwide incidence of GC is increasing at a young age. In view of the limited Indian publication, we sought to characterize clinicopathological parameters and risk factors in the adolescents and young adults (AYA) population. Retrospective data from six centers (which are part of the Network of Oncology Clinical Trials in India) from 2015 to 2020 were collected from patient (18-39 years of age) records. This study was approved by the institutional ethical committee of individual centers. All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS (Version 20). Data interpretation along with the analysis of obtained results was carried out using the following tests: Qualitative data was expressed in terms of frequency/percentage. One-hundred fifty-two AYA GC patients were enrolled. The 31 to 39 years age group was most affected in which 76.3% were females. The majority of patients were nonalcoholic (93.4%), nonsmokers (98.0%), and without a family history (98.0%). The most common (MC) presenting symptom was abdominal pain (67.1%). MC site was antrum (48%). Among esophagogastric junction cancers, the majority were type I and II Siewert classifications (77% [20/26] patients in cardia), MC histology-signet ring cell (67.1%) followed by diffuse-type (65.1%). Most were poorly differentiated (65.1%) and were diagnosed at an advanced stage (III & IV= 54.6%). This is one of our country's first large multicenter studies on GC in the AYA population. There was a higher female prevalence, aggressive tumor behavior and the majority of patients were diagnosed at a more advanced stage. The majority were nonsmokers with a negative family history. Awareness among general people, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers must be improved to better the loss of life years in the younger population.",

        "AbstractText": "S. Shanthala Immunophenotypic discordance of receptors between primary and metastatic sites significantly impacts treatment outcomes. Current international guidelines recommend rebiopsy of accessible metastatic lesions to reassess tissue biomarkers. While existing literature on biomarker changes is conflicting and heterogeneous, similar studies on the Indian cohort of breast cancer patients are lacking. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the frequencies of biomarker changes between biopsies from primary and recurrent sites, and their association with various clinicopathological characteristics, including the type of metastasis and treatment in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. This is an ambispective study performed at a single center. Immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of paired primary and recurrence samples of MBC patients was reviewed for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. Concordance, loss, and gain of receptors were assessed based on the Allred scores for ER, PR, and HER2. Ki-67 was assessed based on a 14% cutoff. Further, receptor changes were studied in relation to age, menopausal status, morphology, grade, stage, metastatic sites, interval between biopsies, and treatment. At progression, biopsies were obtained from 41.18% of locoregional recurrence and 58.82% of metastatic sites. Despite high discordance of 47% for ER and 68.6% for PR, true receptor conversion was observed in 9.8%, 21.56%, and 5.88% for ER, PR, and HER2, respectively. There was a significant correlation between age and ER discordance ( p \u2009=\u20090.029). Loss in PR significantly correlated with a gain in Ki-67. Of all the metastatic sites, the lung was significantly associated with PR and Ki-67 concordance ( p \u2009=\u20090.008 and p \u2009=\u20090.0425, respectively). Discordance of receptors was neither related to the sites of biopsy (local recurrence or metastatic site) nor to the time interval between biopsies, prior chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. In conclusion, metastatic progression of the disease is accompanied by age-dependent discordance of ER. Unparalleled changes in PR in relation to ER suggest that ER-independent pathways may influence PR expression in MBC. Furthermore, the concurrence of PR loss with Ki-67 gain indicates an aggressive phenotype with disease progression. Hence, follow-up testing of samples for receptor expression is beneficial in determining prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions.",

The prognosis remains unfavorable despite treatment, resulting in higher mortality rates. Early stage carcinoma of the tongue is a distinct entity and is primarily treated with either surgery or radiotherapy. Various factors have been implicated in the prognosis of early stage tongue carcinomas. The main objective of this study is to access whether the lymphocytic host response (LHR) and other prognostic factors influence the survival. Patients and Methods \u2003The data of 129 patients with Stage I and Stage II (T1-2, N0) tongue cancer treated in our institute from January 2012 to December 2016 were retrospectively abstracted from the hospital case records.

        "AbstractText": "Lalatendu Moharana The Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors (ALKi) represent the standard of care for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements. Various ALKi agents are available; however, not all eligible patients receive treatment with them due to various reasons. Given the limited real-world data available in our country, we aimed to assess treatment outcomes through a multicenter collaboration. This retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted under the Network of Oncology Clinical Trials India and included a total of 67 ALK-positive metastatic lung cancer patients from 10 institutes across India, with a median follow-up of 23 months. In the first line setting, the objective response rate (ORR) with ALKi was 63.6% (crizotinib: 60.7%, ceritinib: 70%, alectinib: 66.6%, p \u2009=\u20090.508), while with chemotherapy, it was 26.1%. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) for the first line ALKi group was significantly higher than that for chemotherapy (19 vs. 9 months, p \u2009=\u20090.00, hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.54). The mPFS for crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib was 17, 22, and 19 months, respectively ( p \u2009=\u20090.48). Patients who received ALKi upfront or after 1 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy or after 4 or more cycles of chemotherapy had mPFS of 16, 22, and 23 months, respectively ( p \u2009=\u20090.47). ALKi showed superior mPFS compared to chemotherapy in the second line (14 vs. 5 months; p \u2009=\u20090.002) and the third line (20 vs. 4 months; p \u2009=\u20090.009).

Brain progression was higher among those who did not receive ALKi (69.2 vs. 31.5%). In conclusion, the use of ALKi as first line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients resulted in improved PFS. PFS and ORR did not significantly differ between patients who received ALKi upfront or after initiating chemotherapy. Notably, patients who received ALKi in second or later lines demonstrated significantly better outcomes compared to those receiving chemotherapy. The use of ALKi in any line of therapy was associated with significantly prolonged OS.",

Recognizing the need for appropriate toxicity management for cancer patients in Ontario, a Toxicity Management Advisory Committee (TMAC) was established by Ontario Health - Cancer Care Ontario (OH-CCO) in December 2016. The TMAC's recommendations included ensuring patients have access to remote toxicity and symptom management advice (i.e., tele-triage) from a knowledgeable provider. Following the initial success of an after-hours pilot, OH-CCO entered into a partnership with Bayshore HealthCare Limited to launch the provincial after-hours toxicity management telephone support line - CareChart Digital Health - for patients on cancer treatment. The goals of the partnership were to decrease ED utilization through enhanced toxicity management, and to enhance coordination and communication to improve person-centred care. Since 2018, a team of specialized oncology nurses have supported patients across 72 hospitals after hours (e.g., evenings, weekends, and holidays) utilizing evidence-based tele-triage tools including the pan-Canadian Oncology Symptom Triage and Remote Support (COSTaRS) practice guides. Nurses managed most of the calls with self-management strategies and 24% of the callers were referred to the ED. There was an estimated annualized 5,211 ED visits saved, resulting in provincial cost-savings of $3.8 million.

Among painful conditions, there is a lack of evidence in favor of or against the use of SGB for CRPS despite its common use. SGB can provide postoperative analgesia in selective surgeries and can be effective in temporary pain control of refractory angina and the acute phase of herpes zoster infection. Among non-painful conditions, SGB may have beneficial effects on the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), refractory ventricular arrhythmias, hot flashes in postmenopausal women, and breast cancer-related lymphedema. Additionally, there have been various case reports illustrating the benefits of SGB in the management of cerebral vasospasm, upper limb erythromelalgia, thalamic and central post-stroke pain, palmar hyperhidrosis, orofacial pain, etc. In our review of literature, we found that SGB can be useful in the management of various non-painful conditions beyond the well-known treatment for CRPS, although further studies are required to prove its efficacy.",

We investigated the association between exposure to several air pollutants, road traffic noise, and PD risk in two Dutch cohorts. Data from 50,087 participants from two Dutch population-based cohort studies, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition in the Netherlands and Arbeid, Milieu en Gezondheid Onderzoek were analyzed. In these cohorts, 235 PD cases were ascertained based on a previously validated algorithm combining self-reported information (diagnosis, medication, and symptoms) and registry data. We assigned the following traffic-related exposures to residential addresses at baseline: NO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM)2.5absorbance (as a marker for black carbon exposure), PM with aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5), \u226410 \u00b5m (PM10), PMcoarse (size fraction 2.5-10 \u00b5m), ultrafine particles <0.1 \u00b5m (UFP), and road traffic noise (Lden). Logistic regression models were applied to investigate the associations with PD, adjusted for possible confounders. Both single- and two-pollutant models indicated associations between exposure to NOx, road traffic noise, and increasing odds of developing PD. Odds ratios of fully adjusted two-pollutant models in the highest compared with the lowest exposure quartile were 1.62 (95% CI = 1.02, 2.62) for NOx and 1.47 (95% CI = 0.97, 2.25) for road traffic noise, with clear trends across exposure categories. Our findings suggest that NOx and road traffic noise are associated with an increased risk of PD. While the association with NOx has been shown before, further investigation into the possible role of environmental noise on PD is warranted.",

A closed cohort, with information on hunter status, included all individuals living in northern Sweden in 1986. Complete annual information on exposure to 137Cs at the dwelling coordinate was available for a total of 2,104,101 individuals. A nested case-control method with four controls matched for year of cancer diagnosis and year of birth, was used. Individual absorbed organ doses were calculated between 1986 and 2020 including external and internal exposure. Hazard ratios (HR) per mGy with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for rural/nonrural habitat, education level and pre-Chernobyl cancer incidence 1980 to 1985. A total of 161,325 cancer cases in males and 144,439 in females were included. The adjusted HR per mGy for all cancer sites combined was 1.027 (95% CI = 1.022, 1.031) in males and 1.011 (95% CI = 1.006, 1.017) in females. In a post hoc analysis accounting for both remaining confounding from hunter lifestyle and the pre-Chernobyl cancer incidence by county, the adjusted HR per mGy for all cancer sites combined was 1.014 (95% CI = 1.009, 1.019) in males and 1.000 (95% CI = 0.994, 1.006) in females. The post hoc analysis suggested an increased risk of cancer in the colon, pancreas, and stomach, respectively, in males, and lymphoma in females. Increased cancer risk estimates were found for some specific cancer sites but remaining uncontrolled confounding due to hunter lifestyle could not be ruled out.",

However, recruiting high-risk individuals, particularly in deprived populations, for screening remains a considerable challenge. This study aims to co-design a targeted recruitment strategy for lung cancer screening, tailored to the specific needs and experiences of high-risk individuals, in collaboration with a Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) panel and expert stakeholders in Ireland. We will employ a mixed-methods design guided by the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing complex interventions. Our approach will integrate systematic review findings on screening participation interventions, evaluation of the recruitment strategy's feasibility in an Irish context, and the application of behavioural science frameworks. The target population includes individuals over 55 years, either current smokers or those who quit within the last year, who reside in highly deprived areas. This co-designed recruitment strategy will combine evidence-based research, local context understanding, and stakeholder input to develop a solution that is both scientifically robust and tailored to the target population's needs. This patient-centred approach aims to increase the potential for successful implementation of lung cancer screening programs, thereby improving early detection and patient outcomes.",

Trastuzumab became a gamechanger for the treatment of human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer, with a significant positive impact on disease recurrence and survival. The development of trastuzumab was the beginning of a new era of cancer drug development, which showed us the importance of understanding the molecular pathophysiology and drug mechanism of action. The drug-diagnostic codevelopment model, in which the drug is developed in parallel with a predictive biomarker assay, has had a significant impact on today's cancer drug development, and we are indebted to trastuzumab when it comes to the clinical enrichment trial design. Trastuzumab is not the only drug developed to target the HER2 protein. Over the past few decades, several new HER2 targeted therapies have been developed, including small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). In particular, the ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan seems to pave new avenues when it comes to HER2 targeted treatment not only for breast cancer, but also for gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. With the development of trastuzumab as a reference point, this article will provide a brief summary of the efficacy of HER2 targeted therapy, including testing for HER2 positivity, as it has evolved over the past 25 years.",

        "AbstractText": "Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) comprised of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) have found success in modulating antigen (Ag)-specific T cell responses for the treatment multiple immunological diseases. Common methods by which Ags are associated with NPs are through encapsulation and surface conjugation; however, these methods suffer from several limitations, including uncontrolled Ag loading, burst release, and potential immune recognition. To overcome these limitations and study the relationship between NP design parameters and modulation of innate and Ag-specific adaptive immune cell responses, we developed ovalbumin (OVA) protein-PLGA bioconjugate NPs (acNP-OVA). OVA was first modified by conjugation with multiple PLGA polymers to synthesize OVA-PLGA conjugates, followed by precise combination with unmodified PLGA to form acNP-OVA with well-defined Ag loadings, reduced burst release, and reduced antibody recognition. Expression of MHC II, CD80, and CD86 on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) increased as a function of acNP-OVA Ag loading. NanoString studies using BMDCs showed that PLGA NPs generally induced anti-inflammatory gene expression profiles independent of the Ag delivery method, where S100a9, Sell, and Ppbp were most significantly reduced. Co-culture studies using acNP-OVA-treated BMDCs and OT-II CD4+ T cells revealed that Ag-specific T cell activation, expansion, and differentiation were dependent on Ag loading and formulation parameters. CD25 expression was induced using acNP-OVA with the lowest Ag loading; however, the induction of robust CD4+ T cell proliferative and cytokine responses required acNP-OVA formulations with higher Ag loading, which was supported using a regulatory T cell (Treg) induction assay. The distinct differences in Ag loading required to achieve various T cell responses supported the concept of an Ag loading threshold for Ag-specific immunotherapy. We anticipate this work will help guide NP designs and aid in the future development of NP-based immunotherapies for Ag-specific immunomodulation.",

MS is typically associated with spinal nerve roots and there have been only ~20 reports of cutaneous or subcutaneous MS to-date in humans. In canines, there have only been two reports of MS, both associated with spinal root nerves. In this report, we describe a 7-year-old Weimaraner cross breed dog that presented with two pigmented lesions on the eyelids. The lesions were surgically removed and histological analysis revealed well-circumscribed, non-encapsulated, expansile, neoplasms that were displacing most of the dermis and adnexa. The first lesion was composed of spindloid cells arranged in short interlacing streams with large amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm that sometimes contained fine melanin granules. In areas there were spindle cells arranged in verocay bodies which led to a diagnosis of MS. In contrast, the second lesion was composed of polygonal cells arranged in thick sheets with large amounts of pale eosinophilic cytoplasm that sometimes contained fine melanin granules. The diagnosis was melanocytoma (which is one of the macroscopic differential diagnoses for MS). Whilst melanocytoma is a commonly occurring cutaneous lesion in canines and surgical removal is considered curative, due to little being known about MS in dogs, the outcome remained guarded, as MS in humans has an unpredictable nature, and recurrence and metastasis have been reported.",

Emerging evidence suggests that autophagy plays a critical role in HCC tumorigenesis, metastasis, and prognosis. Choline is an essential nutrient related to prolonged survival and reduced risk of HCC. However, it remains unclear whether this phenomenon is mediated by autophagy. Two HCC cell lines (HUH-7 and Hep3B) were used in the present study. Cell growth was evaluated by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), colony formation, and in vivo mouse xenografts assays. Cell motility was calculated by wound healing and transwell assays. Autophagosomes were measured by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and autophagy flux was detected by mRFP-GFP-labeled LC3 protein. The mRNA level of genes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein levels were detected by Western blotting (WB). We found that choline inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells by downregulating autophagy in vitro and in vivo. Upregulated expression of the solute carrier family 5 member 7 (SLC5A7), a specific choline transporter, correlated with better HCC prognosis. We further discovered that choline could promote SLC5A7 expression, upregulate cytoplasm p53 expression to impair the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and attenuate autophagy. Finally, we found that choline acted synergistically with sorafenib to attenuate HCC development in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide novel insights into choline-mediated autophagy in HCC, providing the foothold for its future application in HCC treatment.",

In this review, we aim to summarize some pragmatic histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular pathologic parameters which promisingly indicate the response of neoadjuvant/conversion ICI-related therapy and predict the efficacy of adjuvant/therapeutic ICI-related therapy for HCC. We searched PubMed using the terms hepatocellular carcinoma, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune checkpoint blockade, conversion therapy, neoadjuvant therapy, adjuvant therapy, biomarker, pathologic evaluation, pathologic assessment till February 2023. Although there is no consensus regarding the pathologic evaluation of relevant HCC specimens, it is encouraging that a few of studies have concentrated on this field, and moreover, the methods and parameters noted on other cancer types are also worthy of reference. For the pathologic assessment of HCC specimens underwent immunotherapy, a suitable sampling scheme, identifying immunotherapy-related pathologic response, and quantification of pathologic response rate should be emphasized. For the patients of HCC who are scheduled to receive immunotherapy, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte, intratumoral tertiary lymphoid structure, programmed cell death ligand 1, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, microsatellite instability and mismatch repair, tumor mutational burden and tumor neoantigen, as well as some other signaling pathways are the potential predictive biomarkers of treatment response of ICI.

        "AbstractText": "The application of Pringle maneuver (PM) during hepatectomy reduces intraoperative blood loss and the need for perioperative transfusion, but its effect on long-term recurrence and survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. We sought to determine the association between the application of PM and post-hepatectomy oncologic outcomes for patients with HCC. Patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC at 9 Chinese hospitals from January 2010 to December 2018 were identified. Using two propensity score methods [propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW)], cumulative recurrence rate and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) were compared between the patients in the PM and non-PM groups. Multivariate competing-risks regression models were performed to adjust for the effect of non-cancer-specific mortality and other prognostic risk factors. Of the 2,798 included patients, 2,404 and 394 did and did not adopt PM (the PM and non-PM groups), respectively. The rates of intraoperative blood transfusion, postoperative 30-day mortality and morbidity were comparable between the two groups (all P>0.05). In the PSM cohort by the 1:3 ratio, compared to 382 patients in the non-PM group, 1,146 patients in the PM group also had the higher cumulative 5-year recurrence rate and CSM (63.9% and 39.1% vs. 55.3% and 31.6%, both P<0.05). Similar results were also yielded in the entire cohort and the IPTW cohort. Multivariate competing-risks regression analyses demonstrated that no application of the PM was independently associated with lower recurrence rate and CSM based on various analytical cohorts [hazard ratio (HR), 0.82 and 0.77 in the adjusted entire cohort, HR 0.80 and 0.73 in the PSM cohort, and HR 0.80 and 0.76 in the IPTW cohort, respectively].

Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is essential for gastrointestinal development and homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in inflammation and colorectal cancer. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in regulating host-microbial interactions in health and disease. Here, we aim to demonstrate that intestinal Axin1 determines gut homeostasis and host response to inflammation. Axin1 expression was analyzed in human inflammatory bowel disease datasets. To explore the effects and mechanism of intestinal Axin1 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and colitis, we generated new mouse models with Axin1 conditional knockout in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC; Axin1 \u0394IEC) and Paneth cell (PC; Axin1 \u0394PC) to compare with control (Axin1 LoxP; LoxP: locus of X-over, P1) mice. We found increased Axin1 expression in the colonic epithelium of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Axin1 \u0394IEC mice exhibited altered goblet cell spatial distribution, PC morphology, reduced lysozyme expression, and enriched Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila). The absence of intestinal epithelial and PC Axin1 decreased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in vivo. Axin1 \u0394IEC and Axin1 \u0394PC mice became more susceptible to DSS-colitis after cohousing with control mice. Treatment with A. muciniphila reduced DSS-colitis severity. Antibiotic treatment did not change the IEC proliferation in the Axin1 Loxp mice. However, the intestinal proliferative cells in Axin1 \u0394IEC mice with antibiotic treatment were reduced compared with those in Axin1 \u0394IEC mice without treatment. These data suggest non-colitogenic effects driven by the gut microbiome. In conclusion, we found that the loss of intestinal Axin1 protects against colitis, likely driven by epithelial Axin1 and Axin1-associated A. muciniphila. Our study demonstrates a novel role of Axin1 in mediating intestinal homeostasis and the microbiota. Further mechanistic studies using specific Axin1 mutations elucidating how Axin1 modulates the microbiome and host inflammatory response will provide new therapeutic strategies for human IBD.",

Metastasis develops from cancer cells that invade the stromal tissue and intravasate the circulatory or lymphatic systems to eventually form new tumors in other organs. Blocking cancer cell invasion can potentially prevent or reduce the metastatic progression of cancers. Testing different chemical compounds against cell invasion in three-dimensional cultures is a common laboratory technique. The efficacy of the treatments is often evaluated from confocal microscopic images of the cells using image processing. However, the analysis approaches are often subject to variations and inconsistencies due to user decisions that must be made while processing each image. To overcome this limitation, we developed a fully automated method to quantify the invasion of cancer cells from a 3D tumor spheroid into the surrounding extracellular matrix. We demonstrated that this method resolves cell invasion from spheroids of different shapes and sizes and from cells that invade as a cluster or individually. We also showed that this approach can help quantify the dose-dependent anti-invasive effects of a commonly used chemotherapy drug. Our automated method significantly reduces the time and increases the consistency and accuracy of cancer cell invasion analysis in three-dimensional cultures.",

        "AbstractText": "Cervical screening programmes differ in the age of women recommended for primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing. This study aims to determine the clinical efficacy and impact of 14-high-risk HPV DNA testing for women from 25 years old. This was a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively from women 25 years or older who attended hospital-based gynaecology clinics for cervical screening. Women with history of cervical neoplasia or abnormal cytology were excluded. High-risk HPV DNA testing with partial genotyping for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were performed on cobas 4800 System (Roche Diagnostics International AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Women tested positive for the 12 other high-risk HPV subtypes (HPV-12 other) had a reflex cytology test. Positive screening included positive for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, HPV-12 other with cytology abnormalities equal to or greater than atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and repeated positive HPV at 12 months. HPV detection and colposcopy referral rates, and detection of high-grade neoplasia were determined. Of 10,967 women studied, 822 (7.50%) were HPV DNA positive. The overall discharge rate to routine screening according to screening protocol was 93.1%. Colposcopy referral rate was 4.4%. The screening detected 41 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) (0.37%) and 31 (0.28%) CIN3+. The number of colposcopies needed per case of CIN2+ was 9.5, similar for women below and above 30 years old. The number of colposcopies needed per case of CIN3+ for HPV-16 positivity was 8.5, compared to 17.0 for other categories (P=0.040). Colposcopy efficacy was similar for HPV-18 and HPV-12 other positivity with abnormal cytology. Taking CIN2+ detection and colposcopy referral rate as endpoints, HPV testing in Singapore can be extended to include women from 25 years old.",

        "AbstractText": "This study determines the sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) parameters in predicting treatment response in patients with localised rectal cancer who have undergone preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients with stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the rectum planned for preoperative CRT followed by surgery were recruited. Patients had PET/MRI scans at baseline and 6-8 weeks post-CRT. Functional MRI and PET parameters were assessed for their diagnostic accuracy for tumour regression grade (TRG). Nonparametric receiver operating characteristic analysis was employed to determine the area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the sensitivity and specificity of each quantile cut-off. A total of 31 patients were recruited, of whom 20 completed study protocol. All patients included had mid or lower rectal tumours. There were 16 patients (80%) with node-positive disease at presentation. The median time to surgery was 75.5 days (range 52-106 days). Histopathological assessment revealed 20% good responders (TRG 1/2), and the remaining 80% of patients had a poor response (TRG 3/4). When predicting good responders, the AUC values for percent maximum thickness reduction and percent apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) change were 0.82 and 0.73, respectively. A maximum thickness reduction cut-off of >47% and a percent ADC change of >20% yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 75%/95% and 75%/73%, respectively. Parameters such as percent maximum thickness reduction and percent ADC change may be useful for predicting good responders in patients undergoing preoperative CRT for rectal cancer. Larger studies are warranted to establish the utility of PET/MRI in rectal cancer staging.",

The higher prevalence of targetable genomic alterations in lung cancer diagnosed in Singapore compared with countries in the West, as well as the expanding therapeutic landscape for NSCLC in the era of precision medicine, are both factors that underscore the importance of efficient and effective molecular profiling. This article provides consensus recommendations for biomarker testing for early-stage to advanced NSCLC. These recommendations are made from a multidisciplinary group of lung cancer experts in Singapore with the aim of improving patient care and long-term outcomes. The recommendations address the considerations in both the advanced and early-stage settings, and take into account challenges in the implementation of biomarker testing as well as the limitations of available data. Biomarker testing for both tumour tissue and liquid biopsy are discussed. This consensus statement discusses the approaches and challenges of integrating molecular testing into clinical practice for patients with early- to late-stage NSCLC, and provides practical recommendations for biomarker testing for NSCLC patients in Singapore.",

We enrolled 23 DTC and 17 RAIR-DTC patients prospectively. All patients underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. PSMA expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on histological samples of lymphatic metastasis of 12 patients. We compared the detection rates and semi-quantitative parameters between [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11PET/CT and 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. A total of 72 lesions were detected. Detection rates of DTC and RAIR-DTC by [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were lower than those by 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT (60.00% vs. 90.00%, P\u2009=\u2009.004; 59.38% vs. 96.88%). Compared with DTC, RAIR-DTC had higher semi-quantitative parameters of 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT. There was no significant difference in semi-quantitative parameters of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT between DTC and RAIR-DTC. Immunohistochemistry showed a significantly higher PSMA expression for RAIR-DTC than for DTC. However, there was no significant correlation between PSMA expression and SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT can detect thyroid cancer metastases but its detection rate was lower than that of 2-[18F]FDG PET/CT.

        "AbstractText": "Paediatric neuroblastoma and brain tumours account for a third of all childhood cancer-related mortality. High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. The Zika virus (ZIKV) can access the nervous system and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma. Here, we perform extensive data mining, integration and re-analysis of ZIKV infection datasets to highlight molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We collate infection data of multiple neuroblastoma cell lines by different ZIKV strains from a body of published literature to inform the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating published transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we propose the involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection. Through data mining of published literature, we observed most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines to be highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and propose the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain to be the most promising candidate for neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV infection is dependent on sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism and mammalian translocon. Our work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.",

This paper explores the role of mode of data collection in young adults' decisions to stay in a longitudinal panel. We draw on data from the National Young Adult Health Survey (NYAHS). NYAHS is a longitudinal study (three annual waves and 2 brief between-wave follow-up surveys) of adults aged 18-34 initially recruited in 2019 through RDD sampling of cell phone numbers nationwide. All sampled cell phone numbers were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions; the conditions differed in mode of data collection used in subsequent interviews once screened in. In the first condition, young adults continue all rounds of interviews by telephone (\"telephone only\" condition). The second group of young adults completed one round of interview by web and the rest by telephone (\"telephone mostly\" condition). The last third was asked to complete three interviews online and two interviews by telephone (\"web mostly\" condition). We examined the impact of mode switching on young adults' likelihood of participating in later surveys and on nonresponse bias in key survey outcomes. We found that switching young adults from telephone to web had an immediate negative effect on their likelihood of participating in that web survey, but it did not have a continued negative effect. Switching them from web to telephone increased response rates and reduced nonresponse bias. The findings have important practical implications on how to survey young adults.",

Although Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations are reported to cause non-inflamed phenotype, their role on TME remains controversial. We aimed to clarify the heterogeneity of immunophenotype in HCC with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. This study includes 152 resected HCCs; mutations in the catenin beta-1, adenomatous polyposis coli, or AXIN1, or AXIN2 genes were defined as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. With hierarchical cluster analyses, TME was classified into inflamed or non-inflamed classes based on the gene expressions associated with T-cell activation. Expression profiles of molecules related to cell differentiation and biliary-stem cell markers were compared between the TME classes to investigate whether differences in tumor traits were associated with TME. Forty of 152 (26.3%) HCCs carried the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutations. Of these, 33 were classified as non-inflamed (33/40, 82.5%) and 7 as inflamed (7/40, 17.5%). Non-inflamed class was characterized by low number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells on immunostaining, and high mRNA expressions of AXIN2 and GLUL, which are involved in the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and hepatocyte differentiation, respectively. Non-inflamed tumors showed higher enhancement on the hepatobiliary-phase of gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to inflamed tumors. HCCs classified as inflamed class are revealed to have high numbers of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes on immunostaining. This class is associated with increased expression of anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule and FOXM1 accompanied by upregulation of genes related to interferon-gamma signaling, dendritic cell migration, regulatory T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cell activation and recognized as low enhancement nodule on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Heterogeneity of tumor traits and TME was observed in HCC with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin mutation. The potential was indicated that tumor traits and TME are determined not only by the activation of the HNF4A but also by FOXM1, both of which are downstream transcription factor of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of preoperative lenvatinib therapy for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC. In this multicenter single-arm phase II trial, patients with advanced HCC and factors suggestive of a poor prognosis (macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic metastasis, or multinodular tumors) were enrolled. Patients with these factors, even with technically resectable HCC, were defined as oncologically unresectable because of the expected poor prognosis after surgery. After 8 weeks of lenvatinib therapy, the patients were assessed for resectability, and tumor resection was performed if the tumor was considered technically resectable. The primary endpoint was the surgical resection rate. The secondary endpoints were the macroscopic curative resection rate, overall survival (OS), ORR, PFS, and the change in the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min as measured before and after lenvatinib therapy. The trial was registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (s031190057). Between July 2019 and January 2021, 49 patients (42 oncologically unresectable patients and 7 technically unresectable patients) from 11 centers were enrolled. The ORR was 37.5% based on mRECIST and 12.5% based on RECIST version 1.1. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery (surgical resection rate: 67.3%) without perioperative mortality. The surgical resection rate was 76.2% for oncologically unresectable patients and 14.3% for technically unresectable patients. The 1-year OS rate and median PFS were 75.9% and 7.2 months, respectively, with a median follow-up period of 9.3 months. The relatively high surgical resection rate seen in this study suggests the safety and feasibility of lenvatinib therapy followed by surgical resection for patients with oncologically or technically unresectable HCC.",

Therefore, at present, most clinicians are empirically treating patients with TKIs or retrial of ICI or locoregional treatment (LRT) modality such as transarterial therapy, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation therapy in this clinical setting without solid evidence. In this review, we will discuss current optimal strategies for second-line treatment after the failure of first-line ICI-based therapy by reviewing published studies and ongoing prospective trials. Clinicians should consider carefully whether to treat the patients with TKI, other ICI-based therapy, or LRT in this situation by considering several factors including liver function reserve, performance status, adverse events of previous therapy, and presence of lesion that can consider LRT such as oligoprogression and vascular invasion.

Human peripheral blood samples are widely used for RNAseq, providing valuable insights into individual biomolecular information. Blood samples can be classified as whole blood (WB), plasma, serum, and remaining sediment samples, including plasma-free blood (PFB) and serum-free blood (SFB) samples that are generally considered less useful byproducts during the processes of plasma and serum separation, respectively.

The differences between the professional fee charges and receipts per patient were also considerable for other health care professionals such as anesthesiologists ($4945 charges vs $1406 receipts [28%]) and pathologists ($3035 charges vs $680 receipts [22%]). The surgeon professional fees were only 6% of the total charges, while the professional fees for anesthesiology and pathology were 4% and 2% of the total charges, respectively. Supply charges were 3% of the total charges. Longer operative time was correlated with increased hospital and anesthesia charges, without a significant increase in surgeon charges (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.2, respectively). Male sex, diabetes, and low serum albumin correlated with greater total hospital charges (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.03, respectively). The role of the surgeon in the perioperative clinical care of major pancreatic resection patients is crucial and important and is by no means limited to the operative day. Nevertheless, in the context of the current US health care system, the reimbursement to the surgeon in the form of professional fees is a relatively small fraction of the total health care receipts for these patients. This imbalance necessitates a substantial financial partnership between hospitals and their pancreatic surgery units to ensure the long-term viability of these programs.",

This paper presents a mixed-integer program for combination chemotherapy (utilization of multiple drugs) optimization that incorporates various important operational constraints and, besides dose and concentration limits, controls treatment toxicity based on its effect on the count of white blood cells. To address the uncertainty of tumor heterogeneity, we also propose chance constraints that guarantee reaching an operable tumor size with a high probability in a neoadjuvant setting. We present analytical results pertinent to the accuracy of the model in representing biological processes of chemotherapy and establish its potential for clinical applications through a numerical study of breast cancer.",

Currently, an ample of amount of research is going on to develop new materials to advance its capabilities and increase its potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel, transparent, printable, photocrosslinkable, and tuneable silicone composite that can be utilized as a support bath or an extrudable ink for embedded printing. Its properties can be tuned to achieve ideal rheological properties, such as optimal self-recovery and yield stress, for use in 3D printing. When used as a support bath, it facilitated the generation microfluidic devices with circular channels of diameter up to 30 \u03bcm. To demonstrate its utility, flow focusing microfluidic devices were fabricated for generation of Janus microrods, which can be easily modified for multitude of applications. When used as an extrudable ink, 3D printing of complex-shaped constructs were achieved with integrated electronics, which greatly extends its potential applications towards soft robotics. Further, its biocompatibility was tested with multiple cell types to validate its applicability for tissue engineering. Altogether, this material offers a myriad of potential applications (i.e., soft robotics, microfluidics, bioprinting) by providing a facile approach to develop complicated 3D structures and interconnected channels.",

All rectal cancers should be tested for microsatellite instability prior to treatment decisions. Patients with microsatellite instability are relatively resistant to chemotherapy. However, recent small studies have shown dramatic response with neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Patients with Lynch syndrome have a hereditary predisposition to cancer and thus an elevated risk of metachronous cancer. Therefore, while \"watch and wait\" is a well-established practice for sporadic rectal cancers that obtain a complete clinical response after chemoradiation, its safety in patients with Lynch syndrome has not yet been defined. The extent of surgery for patients with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer is controversial and there is significant debate as to the relative advantages of a segmental proctectomy with postoperative endoscopic surveillance versus a therapeutic and prophylactic total proctocolectomy. Surgical decision making for the patient with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer is complex and demands a multidisciplinary approach, taking into account both patient- and tumor-specific factors. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy show great promise in the treatment of these patients, and further maturation of data from prospective trials will likely change the current treatment paradigm. Patients with Lynch syndrome and rectal cancer who do not undergo total proctocolectomy require yearly surveillance colonoscopies and should consider chemoprophylaxis with aspirin.",

Today, two predominant radiotherapy approaches-hyperfractionated chemoradiotherapy and \"short-course\" radiation-are widely utilized to reduce local recurrence and, in some cases, cure disease. Both have been incorporated into total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) regimens and achieved excellent local control and superior complete response rates compared to chemoradiation alone. Additionally, initial results of \"watch and wait\" protocols utilizing either radiation modality have been promising. Yet, differences do exist; though short course is cheaper and more convenient for patients, recently published data may show superior complete response and local recurrence rates with chemoradiation.

With recent technological developments in the FUS technology and its monitoring/guided techniques such as ultrasound-guided FUS and magnetic resonance-guided FUS (MRgFUS) the need for TMPs are more important than ever to ensure the safety of the patients before being treated with FUS for a variety of diseases (e.g., cancer or neurological). The purpose of this study was to prepare a tumor-mimicking phantom (TUMP) model that can simulate competently a tumor that is surrounded by healthy tissue. The TUMP models were prepared using polyacrylamide (PAA) and agar solutions enriched with MR contrast agents (silicon dioxide and glycerol), and the thermosensitive component bovine serum albumin (BSA) that can alter its physical properties once thermal change is detected, therefore offering real-time visualization of the applied FUS ablation in the TUMPs models. To establish if these TUMPs are good candidates to be used in thermoablation, their thermal properties were characterized with a custom-made FUS system in the laboratory and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) setup with MR-thermometry. The BSA protein's coagulation temperature was adjusted at 55\u00b0C by setting the pH of the PAA solution to 4.5, therefore simulating the necrosis temperature of the tissue. The experiments carried out showed that the TUMP models prepared by PAA can change color from transparent to cream-white due to the BSA protein coagulation caused by the thermal stress applied. The TUMP models offered a good MRI contrast between the TMPs and the TUMPs including real-time visualization of the ablation area due to the BSA protein coagulation. Furthermore, the T2-weighted MR images obtained showed a significant change in T2 when the BSA protein is thermally coagulated. MR thermometry maps demonstrated that the suggested TUMP models may successfully imitate a tumor that is present in soft tissue. The TUMP models developed in this study have numerous uses in the testing and calibration of FUS equipment including the simulation and validation of thermal therapy treatment plans with FUS or MRgFUS in oncology applications.",

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a scalable natural language processing (NLP)- and radiomics-based machine learning pipeline to differentiate between painless and painful BM lesions in simulation computed tomography (CT) images using imaging features (biomarkers) extracted from lesion center point-based regions of interest (ROIs). Patients treated at our comprehensive cancer center who received palliative radiotherapy for thoracic spine BM between January 2016 and September 2019 were included in this retrospective study. Physician-reported pain scores were extracted automatically from radiation oncology consultation notes using an NLP pipeline. BM center points were manually pinpointed on CT images by radiation oncologists. Nested ROIs with various diameters were automatically delineated around these expert-identified BM center points, and radiomics features were extracted from each ROI. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique resampling, the Least Absolute Shrinkage And Selection Operator feature selection method, and various machine learning classifiers were evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Radiation therapy consultation notes and simulation CT images of 176 patients (mean age 66, SD 14 years; 95 males) with thoracic spine BM were included in this study. After BM center point identification, 107 radiomics features were extracted from each spherical ROI using pyradiomics.

We developed a bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random field-based deep-learning NLP pipeline to extract GGO and granular features of GGO retrospectively from radiology notes of 13,216 lung cancer patients. We evaluated the pipeline with quality assessments and analyzed cohort characterization of the distribution of nodule features longitudinally to assess changes in size and solidity over time.

Although AUTOCOD's performance has been established, it remains unclear whether its performance remains consistent over time, particularly during periods of excess mortality. This study aims to assess the sensitivity and other performance metrics of AUTOCOD in classifying underlying causes of death compared with manual coding to identify specific causes of death during periods of excess mortality. We included all DCs between 2016 and 2019. AUTOCOD's performance was evaluated by calculating various performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and F1-score, using a confusion matrix. This compared International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10), classifications of DCs by AUTOCOD with those by human coders at the Directorate-General of Health (gold standard). Subsequently, we compared periods without excess mortality with periods of excess, severe, and extreme excess mortality. We defined excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score above the 95% baseline limit, severe excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score >4 SDs, and extreme excess mortality as 2 consecutive days with a Z score >6 SDs. Finally, we repeated the analyses for the 3 most common ICD-10 chapters focusing on block-level classification. We analyzed a large data set comprising 330,098 DCs classified by both human coders and AUTOCOD. AUTOCOD demonstrated high sensitivity (\u22650.75) for 10 ICD-10 chapters examined, with values surpassing 0.90 for the more prevalent chapters (chapter II-\"Neoplasms,\" chapter IX-\"Diseases of the circulatory system,\" and chapter X-\"Diseases of the respiratory system\"), accounting for 67.69% (223,459/330,098) of all human-coded causes of death. No substantial differences were observed in these high-sensitivity values when comparing periods without excess mortality with periods of excess, severe, and extreme excess mortality. The same holds for specificity, which exceeded 0.96 for all chapters examined, and for PPV, which surpassed 0.75 in 9 chapters, including the more prevalent ones. When considering block classification within the 3 most common ICD-10 chapters, AUTOCOD maintained a high performance, demonstrating high sensitivity (\u22650.75) for 13 ICD-10 blocks, high PPV for 9 blocks, and specificity of >0.98 in all blocks, with no significant differences between periods without excess mortality and those with excess mortality. Our findings indicate that, during periods of excess and extreme excess mortality, AUTOCOD's performance remains unaffected by potential text quality degradation because of pressure on health services.

Our goal was to corroborate the hypothesis that women with previous benign biopsy and cytology assessments would subsequently present increased AI CAD abnormality scores even though they remained healthy. This is a retrospective study applying a commercial AI CAD system (Insight MMG, version 1.1.4.3; Lunit Inc) to a cancer-enriched mammography screening data set of 10,889 women (median age 56, range 40-74 years). The AI CAD generated a continuous prediction score for tumor suspicion between 0.00 and 1.00, where 1.00 represented the highest level of suspicion. A binary read (flagged or not flagged) was defined on the basis of a predetermined cutoff threshold (0.40). The flagged median and proportion of AI scores were calculated for women who were healthy, those who had a benign biopsy finding, and those who were diagnosed with breast cancer. For women with a benign biopsy finding, the interval between mammography and the biopsy was used for stratification of AI scores. The effect of increasing age was examined using subgroup analysis and regression modeling. Of a total of 10,889 women, 234 had a benign biopsy finding before or after screening. The proportions of flagged healthy women were 3.5%, 11%, and 84% for healthy women without a benign biopsy finding, those with a benign biopsy finding, and women with breast cancer, respectively (P<.001). For the 8307 women with complete information, radiologist 1, radiologist 2, and the AI CAD system flagged 8.5%, 6.8%, and 8.5% of examinations of women who had a prior benign biopsy finding. The AI score correlated only with increasing age of the women in the cancer group (P=.01). Compared to healthy women without a biopsy, the examined AI CAD system flagged a much larger proportion of women who had or would have a benign biopsy finding based on a radiologist's decision. However, the flagging rate was not higher than that for radiologists. Further research should be focused on training the AI CAD system taking prior biopsy information into account.",

        "AbstractText": "Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), a class I HDAC enzyme, is crucial for histone modification. Currently, it is emerged as one of the important biological targets for designing small molecule drugs through cancer epigenetics. Along with synthetic inhibitors different natural inhibitors are showing potential HDAC1 inhibitions. In order to gain insights into the relationship between the molecular structures of the natural inhibitors and HDAC1, different molecular modelling techniques (Bayesian classification, recursive partitioning, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations) have been applied on a dataset of 155 HDAC1 nature-inspired inhibitors with diverse scaffolds. The Bayesian study showed acceptable ROC values for both the training set and test sets. The Recursive partitioning study produced decision tree 1 with 6 leaves. Further, molecular docking study was processed for generating the protein ligand complex which identified some potential amino acid residues such as F205, H28, L271, P29, F150, Y204 for the binding interactions in case of natural inhibitors. Stability of these HDAC1-natutal inhibitors complexes has been also evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation study. The current modelling study is an attempt to get a deep insight into the different important structural fingerprints among different natural compounds modulating HDAC1 inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Derived components from saliva and salivary glands of hard ticks Ixodidae have been characterized as potential natural sources for discovering promising anti-cancer drug candidates. The anti-cancer activity of salivary gland extracts (SGEs) from Hyalomma anatolicum, Hyalomma dromedarii, Hyalomma marginatum, and Hyalomma schulzei was assessed. MTT assays and flow cytometry were done on the HT-29 colorectal cancer cell line to evaluate the anti-viability and proliferative inhibition. Based on the MTT assay results, the SGEs from Hy. dromedarii had the highest and lowest substantial anti-viability effects on the HT-29 cancer cell and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) normal cell, respectively. The cytometric assessment revealed a significant increase in the apoptosis and necrosis ratio of the HT-29 cancer cells after treatment with Hy. dromedarii SGEs. The results demonstrated that Hy. dromedarii SGEs have significant anti-proliferative, anti-viability, and apoptotic potential. The result of this study suggests that Hy. dromedarii SGEs is an appropriate candidate for further investigations to identify and purify the mechanisms and molecules involved in the anti-cancer activity of the SGEs.",

Schemes for ccRCC classification system based on multiomics are urgent, to promote further biological insights. Two hundred and fifty-five\u00a0ccRCC patients with paired data of clinical information, transcriptome expression profiles, copy number alterations, DNA methylation, and somatic mutations were collected for identification. Bioinformatic analyses were performed based on our team's recently developed R package \"MOVICS.\"\u00a0With 10 state-of-the-art algorithms, we identified the multiomics subtypes (MoSs) for ccRCC patients. MoS1 is an immune exhausted subtype, presented the poorest prognosis, and might be caused by an exhausted immune microenvironment, activated hypoxia features, but can benefit from PI3K/AKT inhibitors. MoS2 is an immune \"cold\" subtype, which represented more mutation of VHL and PBRM1, favorable prognosis, and is more suitable for sunitinib therapy. MoS3 is the immune \"hot\" subtype, and can benefit from the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We successfully verified the different molecular features of the three MoSs in external cohorts GSE22541, GSE40435, and GSE53573. Patients that received Nivolumab therapy helped us to confirm that MoS3 is suitable for anti-PD-1 therapy.

Antibody screening tests were performed on evorpacept-spiked plasma with (anti-E and anti-Jka) or without alloantibodies at evorpacept concentrations up to 2,000 \u03bcg/mL using manual gel cards and automated analyzers. Evorpacept-coated red blood cells (RBCs) (rr [ce/ce], Fy[a+b-], S-s+) were tested by direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) and antigen typing using anti-Fyb and anti-S reagents at indirect antiglobulin testing (IAT) phase. Evo-NR was used to resolve the interference in plasma and RBC samples. Flow cytometry was used to assess the mitigation effects. Evorpacept-spiked plasma showed panreactive interference in antibody screening tests using manual gel cards (2+ to 3+) and automated analyzers (4+). A carryover effect was also observed in the automated analyzers. The use of a 3- to 6-fold molar excess of Evo-NR effectively resolved the interference in the plasma and enabled accurate alloantibody identification. Although the reduction in evorpacept binding to RBCs was identified via flow cytometry, Evo-NR was incapable of resolving the serologic interference observed in DAT and antigen typing at IAT phase. Evorpacept showed constant panreactivity and a carryover effect at high concentrations. Evo-NR successfully resolved the interference in the plasma samples and could be considered a practical and efficient mitigation solution.

We searched PubMed, NCBI, Scopus, and Google Scholar for the published articles without limitations on publication dates.

Our search initially revealed 600 records on the subject and stored them in the used databases under EndNote X8 management software. A total of 161 articles were selected and through a careful review, 76 were included in our research. We concluded that PCSK9 reduces the number of LDL receptors (LDL-R) on the cell surface, which is linked to its ability to regulate cholesterol levels in the body. Also, we discuss how suppressing PCSK9 leads to the MHC-1 accumulation on the surface of cancer cells, which results in T lymphocyte invasion.

This study was a 2-year prospective study and included 34 colectomy specimens diagnosed as colorectal adenocarcinoma. The expression of PD-L1 was evaluated on tumoral cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and was correlated with various clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 on tumoral cells and tumor microenvironment in CRC revealed positivity in 17.65% of cases each. The PD-L1 expression on tumoral cells was associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) and perineural invasion (PNI) with P- values of 0.012 and 0.005, respectively, while PD-L1 expression on TIICs was associated with tumor budding with a P-value of 0.022.

The study has a descriptive and comparative design. 363 nurses and physicians working with children with cancer in Sweden were invited to participate in April 2017. Participants answered an updated version of a questionnaire used in 1995 by Ljungman et\u00a0al. focusing on the healthcare professionals' experience of pain among their patients, their pain treatment strategies, and need for training. 120 nurses and 65 physicians participated. Fifty percent of nurses and 55% of physicians answered that moderate-to-severe pain was experienced often or very often by children with cancer. Methods recommended in international guidelines to diagnose, evaluate, and treat pain were generally followed. Compared with findings from 1995 by Ljungman et\u00a0al., nurses, and physicians assessed that moderate-to-severe pain was seen more often. The greatest need for training was reported for pharmacology, different routes for administration of opioids, treatment with nitrous oxide, and nonpharmacological interventions. Nurses and physicians assessed that moderate-to-severe pain is often present in children with cancer. More time to treat pain in the department and training in certain areas seem to be needed to improve pain management.",

        "AbstractText": "Mismatch repair deficiency, immunological fertility, and PD-L1 expression status are key histopathological and molecular features defining tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy and, eventually, prognosis. These were investigated in a series of locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) density was assessed in hematoxylin-eosin tissue sections. PD-L1 expression and the expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, PSM2, MSH2, and MSH6) were assessed with immunohistochemistry. Their association with histopathological variables (node involvement and tumor budding) and prognosis was assessed. The TIL-density was significantly higher in the invading tumor front and was inversely related to tumor budding and directly with better overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and 0.02, respectively). Cancer cell PD-L1 expression was related to high TIL-density (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not to prognosis, although its overexpression defined a trend for poorer OS in patients with high TIL-density. High PD-L1 expression by stroma infiltrating immune cells was linked with better OS and DMFS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007 and 0.001, respectively. MMR deficiency was recorded in 26.2\u00a0% of cases, and this was linked with higher TIL-density, but not with prognosis. Dense intratumoral lymphocytic infiltration relates to a better prognosis in rectal cancer, although it is also linked with PD-L1 expression that may adversely modulate the anti-tumor effects of TILs. This latter subgroup of patients (high TIL-density/high cancer cell PD-L1 expression) could be an additional target for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, along with the established subgroup of MMR deficient patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Type I interferons are cytokines involved in innate immunity against viruses. Genetic disorders of type I interferon regulation are associated with a range of autoimmune and cerebrovascular phenotypes. Carriers of pathogenic variants involved in genetic disorders of type I interferons are generally considered asymptomatic. Preliminary data suggests, however, that genetically determined dysregulation of type I interferon responses is associated with autoimmunity, and may also be relevant to sporadic cerebrovascular disease and dementia. We aim to determine whether functional variants in genes involved in type I interferon regulation and signalling are associated with the risk of autoimmunity, stroke, and dementia in a population cohort. We will perform a hypothesis-driven candidate pathway association study of type I interferon-related genes using rare variants in the UK Biobank (UKB). We will manually curate type I interferon regulation and signalling genes from a literature review and Gene Ontology, followed by clinical and functional filtering. Variants of interest will be included based on pre-defined clinical relevance and functional annotations (using LOFTEE, M-CAP and a minor allele frequency <0.1%). The association of variants with 15 clinical and three neuroradiological phenotypes will be assessed with a rare variant genetic risk score and gene-level tests, using a Bonferroni-corrected p-value threshold from the number of genetic units and phenotypes tested. We will explore the association of significant genetic units with 196 additional health-related outcomes to help interpret their relevance and explore the clinical spectrum of genetic perturbations of type I interferon. The UKB has received ethical approval from the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent at recruitment. This research will be conducted using the UKB Resource under application number 93160.

        "AbstractText": "This work concerns the effective personalized prediction of longitudinal biomarker trajectory, motivated by a study of cancer targeted therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Continuous monitoring with a confirmed biomarker of residual disease is a key component of CML management for early prediction of disease relapse. However, the longitudinal biomarker measurements have highly heterogeneous trajectories between subjects (patients) with various shapes and patterns. It is believed that the trajectory is clinically related to the development of treatment resistance, but there was limited knowledge about the underlying mechanism. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to modeling the distribution of subject-specific longitudinal trajectories. It exploits flexible Bayesian learning to accommodate complex changing patterns over time and non-linear covariate effects, and allows for real-time prediction of both in-sample and out-of-sample subjects. The generated information can help make clinical decisions, and consequently enhance the personalized treatment management of precision medicine.",

        "AbstractText": "mRNA therapeutics have emerged as powerful tools for cancer immunotherapy in accordance with their superiority in expressing all sequence-known proteins in vivo. In particular, with a small dosage of delivered mRNA, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can synthesize mutant neo-antigens and multi-antigens and present epitopes to T lymphocytes to elicit antitumor effects. In addition, expressing receptors like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), T-cell receptor (TCR), CD134, and immune-modulating factors including cytokines, interferons, and antibodies in specific cells can enhance immunological response against tumors. With the maturation of in vitro transcription (IVT) technology, large-scale and pure mRNA encoding specific proteins can be synthesized quickly. However, the clinical translation of mRNA-based anticancer strategies is restricted by delivering mRNA into target organs or cells and the inadequate endosomal escape efficiency of mRNA. Recently, there have been some advances in mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy, which can be roughly classified as modifications of the mRNA structure and the development of delivery systems, especially the lipid nanoparticle platforms. In this review, the latest strategies for overcoming the limitations of mRNA-based cancer immunotherapies and the recent advances in delivering mRNA into specific organs and cells are summarized. Challenges and opportunities for clinical applications of mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy are also discussed.",

        "AbstractText": "The tumour-targeting efficiency of systemically delivered chemodrugs largely dictates the therapeutic outcome of anticancer treatment. Major challenges lie in the complexity of diverse biological barriers that drug delivery systems must hierarchically overcome to reach their cellular/subcellular targets. Herein, an \"all-in-one\" red blood cell (RBC)-derived microrobot that can hierarchically adapt to five critical stages during systemic drug delivery, that is, circulation, accumulation, release, extravasation, and penetration, is developed. The microrobots behave like natural RBCs in blood circulation, due to their almost identical surface properties, but can be magnetically manipulated to accumulate at regions of interest such as tumours. Next, the microrobots are \"immolated\" under laser irradiation to release their therapeutic cargoes and, by generating heat, to enhance drug extravasation through vascular barriers. As a coloaded agent, pirfenidone (PFD) can inhibit the formation of extracellular matrix and increase the penetration depth of chemodrugs in the solid tumour. It is demonstrated that this system effectively suppresses both primary and metastatic tumours in mouse models without evident side effects, and may represent a new class of intelligent biomimicking robots for biomedical applications.",

Data were obtained from a nationwide OHCA registry in Japan. Overall, 222,056 patients with OHCA and an initial non-shockable rhythm were identified from the registry in 2016 and 2017. Patients aged <18 years and OHCA caused by cardiogenic origin, cancer, and external factors were excluded. Finally, 58,854 participants were included. Patients were classified into the training dataset (n=29,304, data from 2016) and the test dataset (n=29,550, data from 2017). The training dataset was used to train and develop the machine learning model, and the test dataset was used for internal validation. We selected XGBoost as the machine learning classifier. The primary outcome was the poor prognosis defined as cerebral performance category of 3-5 at 1 month. Eleven prehospital variables were selected as outcome predictors. In validation, the machine learning model predicted the primary outcome with an accuracy of 90.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 90.5-91.2], a sensitivity of 91.4% [CI: 90.7-91.4], a specificity of 74.1% [CI: 69.2-78.6], and an area under the receiver operating characteristic value of 0.89 [0.87-0.92].

Surgical safety analysis: Our three cases (TLPPG group) were compared to data from the CLASS-02 study, which collected data from multiple centers across China for the laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG group). The CLASS-02 study provides data from the most invasive type of gastric surgery, providing solid comparative data to our own.Postoperative short-term efficacy analysis: Patient questionnaire responses provided data on postoperative nutritional and QOL status. Results from our three cases were compared to the Japanese multicenter data PGSAS-37 (PGSAS group). There were no complications or deaths occurred during or after operation in our cases. Compared to the PGSAS group, our cases scored lower for abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and weight loss.

This tumor-resident microorganism has been closely correlated with the occurrence, progression, chemoresistance and immunosuppressive microenvironment of CRC. Furthermore, F. nucleatum can specifically colonize CRC tissues through adhesion on its surface, forming biofilms that are highly resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop efficacious non-antibiotic approaches to eradicate F. nucleatum and its biofilms for CRC treatment. In recent years, various antimicrobial strategies, such as natural extracts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals, polymers, inorganic-organic hybrid materials, bacteriophages, probiotics, and vaccines, have been proposed to combat F. nucleatum and F. nucleatum biofilms. This review summarizes the latest advancements in anti-F. nucleatum research, elucidates the antimicrobial mechanisms employed by these systems, and discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each antimicrobial technology.

Patients with severe mental illness are at higher risk of contracting the virus due to social determinants of health. Vulnerable populations include the elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, and those exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, only a few countries have updated vaccination strategies to prioritize patients with mental illnesses. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether individuals with mental disorders are prioritized in vaccine allocation strategies in different world regions. They are often neglected in policymaking but are highly vulnerable to the threatening complications of COVID-19. A questionnaire was developed to record details regarding COVID-19 vaccination and prioritizations for groups of persons with non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs). NCDs were defined according to the WHO as chronic diseases that are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental, and behavioral factors such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Most countries surveyed (80%) reported healthcare delivery via a nationalized health service. It was found that 82% of the countries had set up advisory groups, but only 26% included a mental health professional. Most frequently, malignancy (68%) was prioritized followed by diabetes type 2 (62%) and type 1 (59%). Only nine countries (26%) prioritized mental health conditions.

Here, we investigated the effects of PFOS on the proliferation and migration of CRC cells and the potential mechanisms involving activating the PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB signal pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It was found that PFOS promoted the growth and migration of HCT116 cells at non-cytotoxic concentrations and increased the mRNA expression of the migration-related angiogenic cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In a mechanistic investigation, the up-stream signal pathway PI3K/Akt-NF-\u03baB was activated by PFOS, and the process was suppressed by LY294002 (PI3K/Akt inhibitor) and BAY11-7082 (NF-\u03baB inhibitor) respectively, leading to less proliferation of HCT116 cells. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and EMT-related markers were up-regulated after PFOS exposure, and were also suppressed respectively by LY294002 and BAY11-7082. Moreover, the up-regulation of EMT markers was suppressed by a MMP inhibitor GM6001.

        "AbstractText": "Magnifying endoscopy enables the diagnosis of advanced neoplasia throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The unified magnifying endoscopic classification (UMEC) framework unifies optical diagnosis criteria in the esophagus, stomach, and colon, dividing lesions into three categories: non-neoplastic, intramucosal neoplasia, and deep submucosal invasive cancer. This study aims to ascertain the performance of North American endoscopists when using the UMEC. In this retrospective cohort study, five North American endoscopists without prior training in magnifying endoscopy independently diagnosed images of gastrointestinal tract lesions using UMEC. All endoscopists were blinded to endoscopic findings and histopathological diagnosis. Using histopathology as the gold standard, the endoscopists' diagnostic performances using UMEC were evaluated. A total of 299 lesions (77 esophagus, 92 stomach, and 130 colon) were assessed. For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 65.2% (95%CI: 50.9-77.9) to 87.0% (95%CI: 75.3-94.6), 77.4% (95%CI: 60.9-89.6) to 96.8% (95%CI: 86.8-99.8), and 75.3% to 87.0%, respectively. For gastric adenocarcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 94.9% (95%CI: 85.0-99.1) to 100%, 52.9% (95%CI: 39.4-66.2) to 92.2% (95%CI: 82.7-97.5), and 73.3% to 93.3%. For colorectal adenocarcinoma, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy ranged from 76.2% (95%CI: 62.0-87.3) to 83.3% (95%CI: 70.3-92.5), 89.7% (95%CI: 82.1-94.9) to 97.7% (95%CI: 93.1-99.6), and 86.8% to 90.7%. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated good to excellent reliability. UMEC is a simple classification that may be used to introduce endoscopists to magnifying narrow-band imaging and optical diagnosis, yielding satisfactory diagnostic accuracy.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between preoperative low skeletal muscle index (SMI) measured by L3 CT and postoperative clinical outcomes in PC resectable patients. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched for articles published through May 2023. Duplicate titles and abstracts, full-text screening, and data extraction were performed. A meta-analysis was performed for overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), morbidity, and postoperative length of stay (P-LOS). The risk of bias was assessed. A total of 2942 patients with PC from 11 studies were identified. Preoperative low SMI was found in 50.9% of PC resectable patients. Preoperative low SMI was significantly associated with adjusted OS (adjusted HR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.25-1.86, P< 0.0001). No significant associations were found between preoperative low SMI and RFS, number of POPF, significant morbidity, and P-LOS (P>0.05). SMI should be evaluated in a timely manner as a predictor of OS in PC resectable patients.

Early detection and proper classification and staging are essential for the prognosis and management of panNENs. Histological evaluation is mandatory in all patients for the diagnosis of panNEN. Regarding localization and staging, multiphasic contrast-enhanced computer tomography is considered the imaging study of choice. Nevertheless, several other diagnostic modalities might present complementary information that can help in diagnosis and staging optimization: magnetic resonance imaging, somatostatin receptor imaging using positron emission tomography in combination with computed tomography (PET/CT), PET/CT with fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), and endoscopic ultrasound. Approximately 10% of panNENs are due to an inherited syndrome, which includes multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), tuberous sclerosis complex, and Mahvash disease. In this review, the Portuguese Pancreatic Club summarizes the classification, diagnosis, and staging of panNENs, with a focus on imaging studies.

        "AbstractText": "Liquid biopsies, in particular the profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), have long held promise as transformative tools in cancer precision medicine. Despite a prolonged incubation phase, ctDNA profiling has recently experienced a strong wave of development and innovation, indicating its imminent integration into the cancer management toolbox. Various advancements in mutation-based ctDNA analysis methodologies and technologies have greatly improved sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA assays, such as optimized preanalytics, size-based pre-enrichment strategies, targeted sequencing, enhanced library preparation methods, sequencing error suppression, integrated bioinformatics and machine learning. Moreover, research breakthroughs have expanded the scope of ctDNA analysis beyond hotspot mutational profiling of plasma-derived apoptotic, mono-nucleosomal ctDNA fragments. This broader perspective considers alternative genetic features of cancer, genome-wide characterization, classical and newly discovered epigenetic modifications, structural variations, diverse cellular and mechanistic ctDNA origins, and alternative biospecimen types. These developments have maximized the utility of ctDNA, facilitating landmark research, clinical trials, and the commercialization of ctDNA assays, technologies, and products. Consequently, ctDNA tests are increasingly recognized as an important part of patient guidance and are being implemented in clinical practice. Although reimbursement for ctDNA tests by healthcare providers still lags behind, it is gaining greater acceptance. In this work, we provide a comprehensive exploration of the extensive landscape of ctDNA profiling methodologies, considering the multitude of factors that influence its development and evolution. By illuminating the broader aspects of ctDNA profiling, the aim is to provide multiple entry points for understanding and navigating the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of ctDNA methodologies, applications, and technologies.",

        "AbstractText": "Physical activity (PA) is significantly associated with many health outcomes. The wide usage of wearable accelerometer-based activity trackers in recent years has provided a unique opportunity for in-depth research on PA and its relations with health outcomes and interventions. Past analysis of activity tracker data relies heavily on aggregating minute-level PA records into day-level summary statistics in which important information of PA temporal/diurnal patterns is lost. In this paper we propose a novel functional data analysis approach based on Riemann manifolds for modeling PA and its longitudinal changes. We model smoothed minute-level PA of a day as one-dimensional Riemann manifolds and longitudinal changes in PA in different visits as deformations between manifolds. The variability in changes of PA among a cohort of subjects is characterized via variability in the deformation. Functional principal component analysis is further adopted to model the deformations, and PC scores are used as a proxy in modeling the relation between changes in PA and health outcomes and/or interventions. We conduct comprehensive analyses on data from two clinical trials: Reach for Health (RfH) and Metabolism, Exercise and Nutrition at UCSD (MENU), focusing on the effect of interventions on longitudinal changes in PA patterns and how different modes of changes in PA influence weight loss, respectively. The proposed approach reveals unique modes of changes, including overall enhanced PA, boosted morning PA, and shifts of active hours specific to each study cohort. The results bring new insights into the study of longitudinal changes in PA and health and have the potential to facilitate designing of effective health interventions and guidelines.",

Subsequently, a prospective, single-arm study was conducted to assess its feasibility and safety in humans. Patients with gastrointestinal neoplasms undergoing endoscopic resection were enrolled. All patients underwent endoscopic surveillance after 4 weeks and outpatient follow-up at week 6. Afterward, they received endoscopic follow-up according to the medical routine. Results In the ex vivo experiments, the submucosal elevation height of AceGel was equivalent to sodium hyaluronate and superior to saline or glycerol. Animal studies showed that the excised wounds healed well without surrounding tissue damage. Twelve patients participated in the clinical trial, including three, two, and seven patients with esophageal, gastric, and colonic lesions, respectively. The mean neoplasm size and submucosal injection volumes were 24.0\u00b18.6 mm and 22.8\u00b119.9 mL, respectively. All patients had adequate wound healing on 4-week surveillance endoscopy, and none had serious adverse events during 6-week follow-up. Moreover, endoscopic follow-up showed complete wound healing after 6 to 46 months without local mucosal inflammation in all patients. Conclusions AceGel is good for endoscopic submucosal injection and demonstrated its usefulness in durable mucosal elevation for endoscopic therapy in preclinical tests.

Research has indicated suboptimal CRC knowledge in Korean Americans as one of the main barriers to their recommended CRC screening. Also, research has shown the potential of online health information seeking (OHIS) to improving cancer knowledge and the gender-based differences in the link between OHIS and cancer knowledge. Thus, this study aimed to examine the association between OHIS and CRC knowledge and the moderating effect of gender in this association among Korean Americans. A cross-sectional survey with purposive sampling was conducted of 421 Korean Americans aged 50 to 75 years in the Southeastern U.S. Three-step hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate if three blocks of variables-Block 1: control variables (sociodemographics and health-related information), Block 2: independent variables (OHIS and gender), and Block 3: an (OHIS \u00d7 gender) interaction term-significantly reduce unexplained variance in CRC knowledge. The analyses showed that the final model fits best accounting for 29.3% of the variance in CRC knowledge. Also, the analyses showed that OHIS was positively associated with CRC knowledge and gender moderated the association between OHIS and CRC knowledge. The findings close the knowledge gap existing in the body of literature on the connection of OHIS to CRC knowledge in Korean Americans. Findings also extend the understanding of gender-specific approaches leveraging OHIS for CRC prevention education among Korean Americans.",

This study aimed to investigate independent risk factors for all-cause mortality in patients with chronic schizophrenia. In addition, the possible causal inter-relationships among these independent risk factors and all-cause mortality were also explored. We conducted an analysis of 1,126 patients with chronic schizophrenia from our psychiatric department from April 2003 to August 2022, and retrospectively reviewed their medical records. The study endpoint was all-cause mortality. Baseline clinical characteristics including sociodemographic data, biochemical data, lifestyle factors, comorbidities and antipsychotic treatment were examined with Cox proportional hazards analysis. The all-cause mortality rate was 3.9% (44 patients). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that several factors were independently associated with all-cause mortality, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, ileus, underweight, fasting glucose, triglycerides, albumin, and hemoglobin. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that several factors had statistically significant direct effects on all-cause mortality. Heart failure, hypertension, underweight, age at onset, and ileus showed positive direct effects, while albumin and hemoglobin demonstrated negative direct effects. In addition, several factors had indirect effects on all-cause mortality. GERD indirectly affected all-cause mortality through ileus, and peptic ulcer disease had indirect effects through albumin and ileus. Ileus, underweight, DM, and hypertension also exhibited indirect effects through various pathways involving albumin, hemoglobin, and heart failure. Overall, the final model, which included these factors, explained 13% of the variability in all-cause mortality. These results collectively suggest that the presence of DM, hypertension, heart failure, GERD, peptic ulcer disease, ileus, and underweight, along with lower levels of albumin or hemoglobin, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. The SEM analysis further revealed potential causal pathways and inter-relationships among these risk factors contributing to all-cause mortality in patients with chronic schizophrenia.",

However, it can also be related to adverse cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) with high morbidities and mortality rates. We present a case of a 65-year-old male with NSCLC who underwent first-line chemotherapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, which was later followed by a second cycle of the same therapies. The patient developed a fever and rash 12 days after the second cycle. Pembrolizumab was strongly suspected as the culprit medication because cutaneous reactions to this drug have been frequently reported and threw other medications used as less likely candidates. This is the first case reported in Vietnam of SJS/TEN related to pembrolizumab and contributes to our knowledge of severe skin reactions associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

Despite advancements in surgery and chemoradiation therapies, pancreatic cancer has a 5-year survival rate of only 11% in the United States. Cryoablation is emerging as a new and effective therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and symptom palliation in metastatic disease. To our knowledge, the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after cryoablation is rare. A 47-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent a Whipple procedure followed by chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Due to the abdominal lymph nodes, peritoneum, right femur, and surrounding soft tissue metastases, she received systemic palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel and underwent right femur tumor excision, open reduction, and internal fixation, followed by radiation therapy. She continued to have persistent pain and underwent palliative percutaneous cryoablation of the metastatic tumor under computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound guidance. Immediately post procedure, she developed slow but continuous blood oozing at the ablation site, which was difficult to control despite compression dressings, reinforcement sutures, and local thrombin powder. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic, with petechiae in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies were consistent with DIC and peripheral blood smear revealed multiple schistocytes. CT angiogram of the right lower extremity did not show any bleeding vessel amenable to embolization. She was transfused red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate. Despite multiple daily transfusions, she continued to have pain and remained persistently thrombocytopenic and coagulopathic. After discussion with the patient and her family, she chose to transition to comfort care measures and died. DIC is an unusual but life-threatening complication of advanced pancreatic cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "A longitudinal observational study was conducted and aimed to examine the change in resilience among spousal caregivers of newly-diagnosed advanced cancer patients over the first six months after initial treatment. In total, 312 Chinese spousal caregivers who were taking care of their patients with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer were recruited. The level of resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale at the first month post-initial treatment (T1), three-month post-initial treatment (T2), and six-month post-initial treatment (T3). Latent growth modeling analyses were performed to examine changes in resilience using Mplus 8.3. The mean scores of resilience in spousal caregivers were 54.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.68 at T1, 56.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.38 at T2, and 57.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.70 at T3, respectively. Results of latent growth modeling indicated that spousal caregivers showed a significant increase in their resilience scores over the first six months post-treatment (Mean slope\u00a0=\u00a01.98, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, a significant individual variation in the rate of changes in resilience scores allowed spouses to be categorized into two groups: 42.9% participants with fast growth and 57.1% participants with slight growth. Our findings highlight the importance that new knowledge about change patterns of resilience in the nursing field is beneficial to reveal different psychosomatic health. Acknowledging that resilience is a dynamic process that changes over time, it is crucial for healthcare providers to monitor the psychological adjustment and focus of vulnerable caregivers, particularly spouses.",

Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO # CRD42021218748) is aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of PDT-induced oxidative stress in OPMDs METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched without restriction of language or year of publication. In addition, gray literature was searched and a manual search was performed. Two independent reviewers screened all the studies, assessing data extraction, risk of bias and certainty of evidence. A narrative synthesis was carried out. For the meta-analysis, random effects were considered to determine the prevalence of a total and a partial remission (PR) of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). The certainty of evidence was explored using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-three studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses. A total of 880 patients were included (564 males; 218 females) with an age range between 24 and 89-years-old. The results showed the prevalence of the total and partial remissions respectively for the following OPMLs: actinic cheilitis (AC): 69.9% and 2.4%; oral leukoplakia (OL): 44% and 36.9%; oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH): 98.5%; oral erythroleukoplakia (OEL): 92.1% and 7.9%. The prevalence of no remission of OL was 18.8%. PDT demonstrated significant results in clinical remission of OPMDs and most of the eligible studies have shown a total or a partial remission of the included lesions, but at a low or a very low certainty of evidence. Hence, further clinical studies with robust methodology are warranted to offer further validated data. Also, further evidence is required to understand further the mechanism of PDT-induced oxidative stress.",

Even with maximal treatment, patients show a low median survival and are often subjected to a high recurrence incidence. The currently available treatments require multimodal management, including maximal safe surgical resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Because of the infiltrative glioblastoma nature, intraoperative differentiation of cancer tissue from normal brain parenchyma is very challenging, and this accounts for the low rate of complete tumor resection. For these reasons, clinicians have increasingly used various intraoperative adjuncts to improve surgical results, such as fluorescent agents. However, most of the existing fluorophores show several limitations such as poor selectivity, photostability, photosensitization and high costs. This could limit their application to successfully improve glioblastoma resection. In the present perspective, we highlight the possibility to develop next-generation fluorescent tools able to more selectively label cancer cells during surgical resection.",

        "AbstractText": "Prussian blue nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy (PBNP-PTT) is an effective tumor treatment capable of eliciting an antitumor immune response. Motivated by the ability of PBNP-PTT to potentiate endogenous immune responses, we recently demonstrated that PBNP-PTT could be used ex vivo to generate tumor-specific T cells against glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines as an adoptive T cell therapy (ATCT). In this study, we further developed this promising T cell development platform. First, we assessed the phenotype and function of T cells generated using PBNP-PTT. We observed that PBNP-PTT facilitated CD8+ T cell expansion from healthy donor PBMCs that secreted IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 and upregulated CD107a in response to engagement with target U87 cells, suggesting specific antitumor T cell activation and degranulation. Further, CD8+ effector and effector memory T cell populations significantly expanded after co-culture with U87 cells, consistent with tumor-specific effector responses. In orthotopically implanted U87 GBM tumors in vivo, PBNP-PTT-derived T cells effectively reduced U87 tumor growth and generated long-term survival in >80% of tumor-bearing mice by Day 100, compared to 0% of mice treated with PBS, non-specific T cells, or T cells expanded from lysed U87 cells, demonstrating an enhanced antitumor efficacy of this ATCT platform. Finally, we tested the generalizability of our approach by generating T cells targeting medulloblastoma (D556), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines. The resulting T cells secreted IFN\u03b3 and exerted increased tumor-specific cytolytic function relative to controls, demonstrating the versatility of PBNP-PTT in generating tumor-specific T cells for ATCT.",

However, the joint selection of fixed and random effects has historically been limited to lower dimensional GLMMs, largely due to the use of criterion-based model selection strategies. Here we present the R package glmmPen, one of the first to select fixed and random effects in higher dimension using a penalized GLMM modeling framework. Model parameters are estimated using a Monte Carlo expectation conditional minimization (MCECM) algorithm, which leverages Stan and RcppArmadillo for increased computational efficiency. Our package supports the Binomial, Gaussian, and Poisson families and multiple penalty functions. In this manuscript we discuss the modeling procedure, estimation scheme, and software implementation through application to a pancreatic cancer subtyping study.

According to the multivariate analysis, the presence of cholestasis (HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.79, p = 0.004), lung metastasis (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.95, p = 0.001), second-line chemotherapy (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.14-2.49, p < 0.001), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10-0.40, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors influencing OS. CUP patients who receive multiple lines of chemotherapy tend to have longer survival. This is the first study to report cholestasis as a prognostic factor in CUP patients. In addition, the presence of lung metastases, not receiving second-line chemotherapy, and ECOG performance status (\u22652) were found to be independent poor prognostic factors.",

        "AbstractText": "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules with a heterogeneous structure consisting of 200 or more nucleotides. Because these noncoding RNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, they have properties similar to messenger RNA (mRNA). Contrary to popular belief, the term \"ncRNA\" originated before the discovery of microRNAs. LncRNA genes are more numerous than protein-coding genes. They are the focus of current molecular research because of their pivotal roles in cancer-related processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing around the world and research on the molecular aspects of PC are growing. In this review, it is aimed to provide critical information about lncRNAs in PC, including the biological and oncological behaviors of lncRNAs in PC and their potential application in therapeutic strategies and as diagnostic tumor markers.",

        "AbstractText": "Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 1 (CSRP1) is involved in the cysteine-rich protein family and is a marker of smooth muscle lineages. In colon cancer, the expression of this gene is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, the aim was to reevaluate its prognostic relationship in independent cohorts and explore potential underlying biological processes that are linked to aggressive behavior in tumors with high CSRP1 expression, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stromal fractions in the tumor microenvironment, and consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs). RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-, microarray-, and single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq)-based transcriptomic data were obtained from public databases. The EMT score was calculated based on the expression of E-cadherin and vimentin genes using a previously published method. The stromal score generated by the ESTIMATE method was utilized for the analysis of correlation with the CSRP1 expression. The scRNAseq data were analyzed via the Seurat R package. The immunohistochemistry-based protein level expression of CSRP1 was evaluated using the Human Protein Atlas database. Lower CSRP1 expression was noted in colon tumors compared to normal colon tissue. Patients with a high CSRP1 expression had shorter recurrence-free, overall, and disease-specific survivals in the GSE39582 and GSE17536 datasets (p < 0.05). The methylation level of the CSRP1 gene was negatively correlated (r = -0.57, p < 0.0001) with CSRP1 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas colon adenocarcinoma dataset. CSRP1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of mesenchymal markers, EMT score, and stromal score obtained via the ESTIMATE method. CMS4 colon tumors had a significantly higher CSRP1 expression compared to other CMSs. Analysis of the scRNAseq data revealed that CSRP1 was expressed by epithelial cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the colorectal tumor microenvironment, which was also confirmed by the protein expression data from the Human Protein Atlas database. CSRP1 expression is associated with CMS4, a more mesenchymal stroma-rich molecular profile, and poor prognosis in colon cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a form of leukemia characterized by the proliferation of immature T lymphocytes. NOTCH1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in T-ALL. NOTCH1 expression in T-cell development depends on plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6), which plays a tumor suppressor role in T-ALL. Several studies have shown that PHF6 expression is essential for NOTCH1 expression. Therefore, whether posttranslational modification of PHF6 plays a role in the regulation of NOTCH1 expression and T-ALL cell line proliferation was investigated herein. The amino acid sequence of PHF6 was analyzed and it was found that a putative protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation motif RDRS199 was conserved in several vertebrate species and the S199 site was expected to be phosphorylated according to the PhosphoSite database. Therefore, an eukaryotic expression vector of human PHF6 was constructed, and the codon 199 was changed to the codon encoding the nonphosphorylatable alanine and the phosphorylation-mimicking aspartic acid via site-directed mutagenesis. After confirming the ectopic expressions of the PHF6 vectors by western blot analysis, the effects of these proteins were identified on the NOTCH1 expression using western blot analysis, leukemic cell proliferation using MTT assay, and expressions of the cell surface markers of T-cells using flow cytometry. The ectopic expression of wild-type PHF6 stimulated the formation of CD4 + T-cells. While the expression of the wild-type PHF6 suppressed the growth of the leukemic cell line, this effect was diminished in both the alanine and aspartic acid mutants of PHF6. In addition, both mutants also seemed to negatively affect the NOTCH1 expression, although the effect of the alanine mutant was more severe. Taken together, the different biological activities exerted by the conserved S199 phosphorylation-site mutants shown in this study implicate that signaling pathway(s) leading to differential phosphorylation of this residue may have a substantial effect on the activity of PHF6, and thus may constitute a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.",

Methods: We searched our prospectively collected endocrine surgery thyroid nodule (TN) database, with particular attention to those solid nodules that were NC ATA. An algorithm assigned each into one of the five ATA risk groups per the 2015 American Thyroid Association Ultrasound Risk Stratification System (ATA USRSS). TNs that the algorithm could not assign to a risk group were deemed NC ATA and were subsequently analyzed. Additionally, we categorized this group using an algorithm based on the 2017 American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS). We were specifically interested in the characteristics that resulted in non-classification by the 2015 ATA USRSS and the fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) cytology and surgical pathology results from the group. Results: We evaluated data from 5,040 nodules, of which 1,772 had surgical pathology. There were 150 solid nodules not classified by 2015 ATA USRSS, all of which demonstrated atypical features along with iso-, hetero-, hyper-and mixed echogenicity (solid atypical mixed echogenicity nodules-SAMENs). Sixty of these nodules were excised and sent for surgical pathology, while 90 were followed without surgical excision. Out of the 90 that did not undergo surgery, 82 underwent FNAB with cytologic evaluation. Of our 150 SAMENs, 40 were malignant by surgical histology and six were likely malignant by cytology (total SAMEN ROM without noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-l ike nuclear features 31%). The most common sonographic pattern present in our SAMEN group consisted of an isoechoic solid component with microcalcifications (28/40-70% of all excised malignant nodules).

Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that SAMENs with at least one suspicious sonographic feature: including (1) microcalcifications; (2) irregular or other suspicious margins,;opulation, and a higher ROM (31%) than the intermediate-risk group of the 2015 ATA USRSS (10-20%).",

Tumor delineation with intraoperative use of sodium fluorescein (NaFl) facilitates total resection. When used with AC, it may allow for safe resection without increasing the risk of postoperative neurologic deficits. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the combined use of NaFl and AC for maximum safe resection in patients with brain metastases. Patients who underwent AC due to brain metastasis in the Department of Neurosurgery of Uluda\u011f University's Faculty of Medicine between January 1, 2018 and August 1, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The study comprised 2 patient groups: plain AC (pAC) and NaFl-guided AC (NaFlg-AC). Surgical outcomes related to fluorescence intensity, degree of resection, perioperative complications, and postoperative neurological factors were evaluated. The pAC group included 16 patients (12 males, 4 females), and the NaFlg-AC group comprised 21 (13 males, 7 females). The mean patient ages for males and females were 61.4 years (61.4 \u00b1 9.5 years) and 60.4 years (60.6 \u00b1 12 years), respectively. The most common origin of the metastatic lesion was the lung in both the pAC and NaFlg-AC groups (n = 12 vs. n = 14, respectively). Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 85.7% of the patients in the NaFlg-AC group, whereas the GTR rate was 68.7% in the pAC group. There was no significant difference in GTR rates between the 2 groups (p = 0.254). The mean duration of the resection time was significantly shorter in the NaFlg-AC group (45.95 \u00b1 7.00 min vs. 57.5 \u00b1 12.51 min; p = 0.002). The patients' Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score did not reach statistical significance at 6-month follow-up in either group compared to their preoperative baseline scores (p = 0.374). KPS did not show a significant difference between the 2 groups at any time. Fluorescence-guided resection in AC for metastatic tumors in sensory, motor, and cognitive areas is a feasible, safe, and convenient technique that significantly increases GTR rates and shortens operative time compared to conventional white light surgery without fluorescence guidance. It also does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. With the combined use of AC and NaFl, ensuring clear and visible tumor margins during surgery and controlling patients' neurological function in real-time are possible.",

The system productively accumulated in tumors by specific binding of phenylboronic acid (PBA) to sialic acids (SA). The nanoparticles (NPs) rapidly swelled and released quercetin (QUE) and doxorubicin (DOX) upon the stimulation of tumor microenvironment (TME). The in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo results consistently demonstrated that the NPs improved anti-tumor efficacy and prolonged survival of mice, significantly enhancing the effects of the combination. Our study revealed DOX was an ICD inducer, stimulating immune responses and promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, QUE served as a TME regulator by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2)-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) axis, which influenced various immune cells, including increasing cytotoxic T cells (CLTs) infiltration, promoting M1 macrophage polarization, and reducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltration. The combination synergistically facilitated chemoimmunotherapy efficacy by remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work presents a promising strategy to increase anti-tumor efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The inhibitory effect of adenosine on tumor adaptive immunity and intervention strategies.",
        "AbstractText": "Adenosine (Ado) is significantly elevated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared to normal tissues. It binds to adenosine receptors (AdoRs), suppressing tumor antigen presentation and immune cell activation, thereby inhibiting tumor adaptive immunity. Ado downregulates major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and co-stimulatory factors on dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, inhibiting antigen presentation. It suppresses anti-tumor cytokine secretion and T cell activation by disrupting T cell receptor (TCR) binding and signal transduction. Ado also inhibits chemokine secretion and KCa3.1 channel activity, impeding effector T cell trafficking and infiltration into the tumor site. Furthermore, Ado diminishes T cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells by promoting immune-suppressive cytokine secretion, upregulating immune checkpoint proteins, and enhancing immune-suppressive cell activity. Reducing Ado production in the TME can significantly enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve the efficacy of other immunotherapies. Preclinical and clinical development of inhibitors targeting Ado generation or AdoRs is underway. Therefore, this article will summarize and analyze the inhibitory effects and molecular mechanisms of Ado on tumor adaptive immunity, as well as provide an overview of the latest advancements in targeting Ado pathways in anti-tumor immune responses.",

        "AbstractText": "Autophagy is an important factor in reducing the efficacy of tumor phototherapy (including PTT and PDT). Accurate regulation of autophagy in tumor cells is a new strategy to improve the anti-tumor efficiency of PTT/PDT. This project intended to construct a tumor-activated autophagy regulator to efficiently block PTT/PDT-induced autophagy and realize synergistic sensitization to tumor phototherapy. To achieve this goal, we first synthesized TRANSFERRIN (Tf) biomimetic mineralized nano-tellurium (Tf-Te) as photosensitizer and then used disulfide bond reconstruction technology to induce Tf-Te self-assembly. The autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and iron ions carried by Tf were simultaneously loaded to prepare a tumor-responsive drug reservoir Tf-Te/HCQ. After entering breast cancer cells through the \"self-guidance system\", Tf-Te/HCQ can generate hyperpyrexia and ROS under NIR laser irradiation, to efficiently induce PTT/PDT effect. Meanwhile, the disulfide bond broke down in response to GSH, and the nanoparticles disintegrated to release Fe2+ and HCQ at fixed points. They simultaneously induce lysosomal alkalinization and increased osmotic pressure, effectively inhibit autophagy, and synergistically enhance the therapeutic effect of phototherapy. In\u00a0vivo anti-tumor results have proved that the tumor inhibition rate of Tf-Te/HCQ can be as high as 88.6% on 4T1 tumor-bearing mice. This multifunctional drug delivery system might provide a new alternative for more precise and effective tumor phototherapy.",

The irradiation of tissues in mouse models necessitates high levels of precision and accuracy to recapitulate clinical exposures and limit adverse effects on animal welfare. This requirement has been met by technological advances in preclinical RT platforms established over the past decade. Small animal RT systems use onboard computed tomography (CT) imaging to delineate target volumes and have significantly refined radiobiology experiments with major 3Rs impacts. However, the CT imaging is limited by the differential attenuation of tissues resulting in poor contrast in soft tissues. Clinically, radio-opaque fiducial markers (FMs) are used to establish anatomical reference points during treatment planning to ensure accuracy beam targeting, this approach is yet to translate back preclinical models. We report on the use of a novel liquid FM BioXmark \u00ae developed by Nanovi A/S (Kongens Lyngby, Denmark) that can be used to improve the visualisation of soft tissue targets during beam targeting and minimise dose to surrounding organs at risk. We present descriptive protocols and methods for the use of BioXmark \u00ae in experimental male and female C57BL/6J mouse models. These guidelines outline the optimum needle size for uptake (18-gauge) and injection (25- or 26-gauge) of BioXmark \u00ae for use in mouse models along with recommended injection volumes (10-20 \u00b5l) for visualisation on preclinical cone beam CT (CBCT) scans.

However, owing to the lack of sensitivity and resolution, IMS has an analytical challenge in studying the CCS values of very low-molecular-weight metabolites (VLMs \u2264 250\u00a0Da). Here, we describe an analytical method using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a traveling wave ion mobility-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer optimized for the measurement of VLMs in human urine samples. The experimental CCS values, along with mass spectral properties, were reported for the 174 metabolites. The experimental data included the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), retention time (RT), tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra, and CCS values. Among the studied metabolites, 263 traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS)-derived CCS values (TWCCSN2) were reported for the first time, and more than 70% of these were CCS values of VLMs. The TWCCSN2 values were highly repeatable, with inter-day variations of <1% relative standard deviation (RSD). The developed method revealed excellent TWCCSN2 accuracy with a CCS difference (\u0394CCS) within \u00b12% of the reported drift tube IMS (DTIMS) and TWIMS CCS values. The complexity of the urine matrix did not affect the precision of the method, as evidenced by \u0394CCS within \u00b11.92%. According to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, 55 urinary metabolites were identified with a confidence level of 1.

The diagnosis of PHEO was determined by a significant increase of free metanephrin/normethanephrin levels in daily urine, a malignant CT phenotype of the right adrenal tumor, and confirmed by pathomorphological study. Genetic tests revealed a new mutation in one of the alleles of NF1 gene, a deletion of a 566 bp gene fragment, including exon 19 with a size of 73 bp.

The increased production of hormones by the tumor leads to catecholamine crises, which have a pathological effect on all organs and systems. In the primary diagnosis of pheochromocytomas, it is important to determine the level of the metabolite of catecholamines - metanephrines. Currently, in clinical practice, various methods are used to determine the level of this metabolite: in blood plasma or in urine, total or only free form, fractionated analysis or unfractionated. Comparison of the effectiveness of various methods for determining the level of metanephrines for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas. A retrospective single-center cohort study was conducted on a sample of patients who were initially operated on for adrenal neoplasm at the Pirogov St. Petersburg State University High Medical Technology Clinic from November 2007 to December 2022 and who passed analysis to determine the level of blood or urine metanephrins before surgical treatment. The results of tests for metanephrine and tumor size were evaluated. 1088 patients with adrenal neoplasms who underwent surgical treatment were examined, of which 348 had histologically confirmed the presence of pheochromocytoma. Four types of metanephrine assays were compared: free fractionated plasma metanephrines (232 patients), unfractionated daily urine metanephrines (431 patients), fractionated total daily urine metanephrines (427 patients) and fractionated free daily urine metanephrines (178 patients). The greatest sensitivity was demonstrated by the analysis of free fractionated plasma methanephrines (95.4%). Unlike others, the sensitivity of this analysis did not decrease in the group of patients with small pheochromocytomas (3 cm or less). The greatest specificity was demonstrated by the analysis of unfractionated metanephrines in daily urine (97.8%), with the lowest sensitivity among all tests (67.6%). The study of fractionated total daily urine metanephrins showed good results of sensitivity and specificity, only slightly inferior to the best indicators, and the analysis of free daily urine metanephrins demonstrated unexpectedly low efficiency. There is a positive correlation between the level of metanephrine in the blood and the size of the tumor. Based on the data obtained, the preferred assays for the primary diagnosis of pheochromocytoma can be considered the determination of fractionated free plasma metanephrines and fractionated total daily urine metanephrines, which is consistent with relevant clinical recommendations. It was found that the size of the tumor correlates with the severity of an increase in the level of metanephrins determined by any of the described methods.",

The most common clinical manifestations of TSH-PA were: cardiac arrhythmia in 37 (82.2%) patients, thyroid pathology in 27 (60%), neurological disorders in 24 (53.35%). Most PAs were macroadenomas (n=35, 77.8%). Preoperatively, 28 (77.8%) patients received somatostatin analogs, and 20 (71.4%) patients were euthyroid at the time of surgery.

        "AbstractText": "This review aims to determine the potential role of Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) in the pathogenesis of cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. A PRISMA systematic search appraisal was conducted. The Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE databases for publications in English were searched up to September 2022 for all relevant articles. All articles that have outlined the contributions of the MCPyV to cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas were included. The six databases produced 6806 articles. Only six articles met the inclusion criteria and were included. The protocol of this review was submitted and registered with the PROSPERO (Code no. CRD42022369197). The total sample size across the articles was 1135; the age of the participants ranged between 18 and 75 years. In addition, the included articles were conducted between 2012 to 2016. All included articles have a cross-sectional design.Furthermore, different kinds of samples were collected in the reviewed articles, namely cervical tissue biopsies, cervical smears, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded resection specimens, and cervical adenocarcinomas. Moreover, five articles showed no statistically significant association between the MCPyV and cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. In contrast, one article revealed a positive association between MCPyV and cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. MCPyV could not be associated with the pathogenesis of cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. Further attention should be given to examining this association, and further studies with a large sample size are recommended to confirm these findings.",

        "AbstractText": "Residents of Appalachia experience elevated rates of morbidity and mortality compared to national averages, and these disparities are associated with inequitable exposures to various determinants of population health. Social and environmental determinants of health are a useful lens through which to develop and evaluate programs to mitigate regional health disparities. This 2023 scoping review was conducted of studies linking determinants of Appalachian health with leading causes of regional mortality and morbidity. The search strategy employed a keyword search that included geographic terms for the Appalachian Region and the primary adverse health outcomes in that region. Studies meeting the following inclusion criteria were reviewed: original article, published in the last five years, involving an Appalachian population, and includes a rigorous assessment of an association between a population health determinant and one or more leading causes of Appalachian morbidity and mortality. The search returned 221 research articles, including 30 interventional studies. The top three health outcomes included cancer (43.59%), diseases of despair (23.08%), and diabetes (12.82). Access to care (27.3%), rurality (18.9%), and education (14.8%) were the most common population health determinants identified. Interventional studies were categorized by program types: education, technology, partnerships, and multilevel interventions. Due to the heterogeneity of study types, the studies were combined using a narrative synthesis. The results of this work can inform the development and evaluation of additional programs to promote Appalachian population health. Our study team will use these results to inform community-based discussions that develop strategic plans to mitigate health disparities in Central and Southcentral Appalachian Virginia.",

        "AbstractText": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor and a significant cause of skin cancer-related death. Timely diagnosis and treatment require identification of specific biomarkers in exosomes secreted by melanoma cells. In this study, label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method with size-matched selectivity was used to detect membrane proteins in exosomes released from a stimulated environment of fibroblasts (L929) co-cultured with melanoma cells (B16-F10). To promote normal secretion of exosomes, micro-plasma treatment was used to gently induce the co-cultured cells and slightly increase the stress level around the cells for subsequent detection using the SERS method. Firstly, changes in reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) concentrations in the cellular microenvironment and the viability and proliferation of healthy cells are assessed. Results showed that micro-plasma treatment increased extracellular ROS/RNS levels while modestly reducing cell proliferation without significantly affecting cell survival. Secondly, the particle size of secreted exosomes isolated from the culture medium of L929, B16-F10, and co-cultured cells with different micro-plasma treatment time did not increase significantly under single-cell conditions at short treatment time but might be changed under co-culture condition or longer treatment time. Third, for SERS signals related to membrane protein biomarkers, exosome markers CD9, CD63, and CD81 can be assigned to significant Raman shifts in the range of 943-1030 and 1304-1561 cm-1, while the characteristics SERS peaks of L929 and B16-F10\u00a0cells are most likely located at 1394/1404, 1271 and 1592 cm-1 respectively. Therefore, this micro-plasma-induced co-culture model provides a promising preclinical approach to understand the diagnostic potential of exosomes secreted by cutaneous melanoma/fibroblasts. Furthermore, the label-free SERS method with size-matched selectivity provides a novel approach to screen biomarkers in exosomes secreted by melanoma cells, aiming to reduce the use of labeling reagents and the processing time traditionally required.",

        "AbstractText": "Detection of elements in individual cells by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry has recently attracted significant interest in biological research, due to the unique ability of ICP spectrometry for trace element analysis. However, performing single-cell analysis using ICP optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) remains a challenge due to the small size and discrete nature of cells. This is while ICP-OES can serve as a cost-effective and label-free method for this purpose. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the current ICP-OES technique to facilitate the detection of elements in single cells, thereby unlocking novel applications. A new conical ICP torch, which has been illustrated to offer better analytical performance than the conventional ones, was applied to achieve the detection of calcium in single micro-sized cells. A new heated chamber was designed and coupled with a high-efficiency nebulizer as the sample introduction system. For the detection of single SiO2 particles, the number of particle events obtained by the new sample introduction system was found to be up to 9 times higher than that of the conventional system without sacrificing the signal intensity. Subsequently, calcium in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), mice breast cancer cells (Py8119), and mice osteocytes (MLO-Y4) was successfully detected using the new ICP-OES system. The cell detection efficiency turned out to be around 2%-3% which is much higher than that the reported values in previous single-cell ICP-OES research. Finally, as a new application, the effect of Yoda1, a recently identified activator of Piezo1 calcium channel, on osteocytes was investigated. The calcium content in Yoda1-treated MLO-Y4 cells was seen increase by 36% compared to the control sample. This research reveals the capability of ICP-OES in single-cell analysis for micro-sized cells which was made possible by the new conical ICP torch and the new sample introduction system. The ability to detect calcium in single mammalian cells enables the first ever application of this technique to assess the impact of the Yoda1 activator on the calcium level in osteocytes.",

        "AbstractText": "Post-operative pathogenic infections in liver transplantation seriously threaten human health. It is essential to develop novel methods for the highly sensitive and rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Interestingly, the combination of the property of bacteria to secrete hydrogen peroxidase, bacterial metabolism-triggered-chemiluminescence (CL)-based bioassays can be as a candidate point-of-care testing (POCT) for the detection of S. aureus against the CL substrate Luminol and hydrogen peroxide without excitation light sources. Here, a CL-based strategy with stable and visualized CL intensity was fabricated according to a hybrid biomimetic enzyme of copper-Hemin metal-organic framework, which enhances the biological enzyme activity while improving the stability and sensitivity of the assay. By further integrating S. aureus-specific capture and one-step separation of the antibody-modified Fe3O4 NPs (Fe3O4 NPs@Ab), the portable device integrated smartphone enables CL-based POCT for specific detection of S. aureus in the range of 101-106\u00a0CFU/mL with a limit of detection as low as 1\u00a0CFU/mL. Specifically, S. aureus can be eliminated after detection with high antibacterial efficiency due to the excellent photothermal properties of Fe3O4 NPs@Ab.

        "AbstractText": "APOBEC3A (A3A) is a cytidine deaminase with critical roles in molecular diagnostics. Herein, we demonstrate the enzymatic DNA repairing amplification-powered construction of an Au nanoparticle-based nanosensor for single-molecule monitoring of A3A activity in cancer cells. Target A3A can convert cytosine (C) in substrate probe to uracil (U), and then the template binds with substrate probe to form a dsDNA containing U/A base pairs. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) excises the U base to produce an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that can be cleaved by apurinic/apyrimidic endonuclease 1 (APE1) to obtain the substrate fragment with 3'-OH end. Subsequently, the substrate fragment initiates cyclic enzymatic repairing amplification (ERA), releasing trigger-1 and trigger-2. The resultant trigger-1 can act as the primer to induce multiple cycles of cyclic ERA, producing numerous trigger-1 and trigger-2. The hybridization of trigger-2 with signal probe forms the dsDNA duplexes with an AP site, inducing the cyclic cleavage of signal probes by APE1 to release abundant Cy5 molecules from the AuNPs. Released Cy5 molecules can be easily quantified by single-molecule imaging. This nanosensor allows for specific and sensitive detection of A3A activity with a detection limit of 0.855 aM, and it can further measure kinetic parameters, screen inhibitors, and quantify endogenous A3A activity at the single-cell level, with prospect application in disease diagnostics and therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a very rare diffuse lung disease characterized by the accumulation of amorphous and periodic acid Schiff-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces due to impaired surfactant clearance by alveolar macrophages. Three main types were identified: Autoimmune, secondary and congenital. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis has been previously reported to be associated with several systemic auto-immune diseases. Accordingly, we present the first case report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with myasthenia gravis. Case: A 27-year-old female patient, ex-smoker, developed a dyspnea on exertion in 2020. The chest X-ray detected diffuse symmetric alveolar opacities. Pulmonary infection was ruled out, particularly COVID-19 infection. The chest scan revealed the \"crazy paving\" pattern. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed a rosy liquid with granular acellular eosinophilic material Periodic acid-Schiff positive. According to the lung biopsy results, she was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies were negative. Nine months later, she was diagnosed with bulbar seronegative myasthenia gravis, confirmed with the electroneuromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showing significant amplitude decrement of the trapezius and spinal muscles. She was treated with pyridostigmine, oral corticosteroids and azathioprine. Given the worsening respiratory condition of the patient, a bilateral whole lung lavage was performed with a partial resolution of symptoms. Thus, this previously unreported association was treated successfully with rituximab, including improvement of dyspnea, diplopia and muscle fatigability at six months of follow-up. Conclusions: This case emphasizes on the possible association of auto-immune disease to PAP, which could worsen the disease course, as the specific treatment does not exist yet. Hence, further studies are needed to establish clear-cut guidelines for PAP management, particularly when associated to auto-immune diseases.",

We included patients from de-identified electronic health record-derived database diagnosed with stage IV small cell lung cancer (2014-2021) who completed 4 to 6 cycles of first-line systemic therapy (platinum-doublet chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy). We evaluated OS and PFS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with receipt of cTRT as an independent variable and stratified by sex. As a sensitivity analysis, we weighted the models by the inverse probability of receiving cTRT. A total of 1227 patients were included (850 chemotherapy, 377 chemoimmunotherapy). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients who did and did not receive cTRT. Among women, cTRT was associated with superior OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) and PFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82) compared with those not receiving cTRT. Conversely, no OS or PFS benefit with cTRT was observed in men (OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.31; PFS HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85-1.47). Findings were similar in weighted analyses. The survival efficacy of cTRT may be moderated by sex, with female patients appearing more likely to benefit than male patients. These findings reflect sex-based survival trends with similar effect sizes to those observed in the CREST trial. Although the underpinnings of this association need to be elucidated, stratification by sex should be considered for randomized-controlled trials studying cTRT in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Ichthyosporea, a clade of holozoans, represent a clade closely related to animals, and thus hold a key phylogenetic position for understanding the origin of animals. We have previously discovered that an ichthyosporean, Sphaeroforma arctica, contains microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as the miRNA processing machinery. This was the first discovery of miRNAs among the closest single-celled relatives of animals and raised intriguing questions about the roles of regulatory small RNAs in cell development and differentiation in unicellular eukaryotes. Like many ichthyosporeans, S. arctica also undergoes a transient multicellular developmental life cycle. As miRNAs are, among other roles, key regulators of gene expression during development in animals, we wanted to investigate the dynamics of miRNAs during the developmental cycle in S. arctica. Here we have therefore collected a comprehensive time-resolved small RNA transcriptome linked to specific life stages with a substantially higher sequencing depth than before, which can enable further discovery of functionally relevant small RNAs. The data consists of Illumina-sequenced small RNA libraries from two independent biological replicates of the entire life cycle of S. arctica with high temporal resolution. The dataset is directly linked and comes from the same samples as a previously published mRNA-seq dataset, thus enabling direct cross-functional analyses.",

To date, little is known about time\u2010dependent kinetic rates during dynamic processes. Here, we present SLAM\u2010Drop\u2010seq, a method that combines RNA metabolic labeling and alkylation of modified nucleotides in methanol\u2010fixed cells with droplet\u2010based sequencing to detect newly synthesized and preexisting mRNAs in single cells. As a first application, we sequenced 7280 HEK293 cells and calculated gene\u2010specific kinetic rates during the cell cycle using the novel package Eskrate. Of the 377 robust\u2010cycling genes that we identified, only a minor fraction is regulated solely by either dynamic transcription or degradation (6 and 4%, respectively). By contrast, the vast majority (89%) exhibit dynamically regulated transcription and degradation rates during the cell cycle. Our study thus shows that temporally regulated mRNA degradation is fundamental for the correct expression of a majority of cycling genes. SLAM\u2010Drop\u2010seq, combined with Eskrate, is a powerful approach to understanding the underlying mRNA kinetics of single\u2010cell gene expression dynamics in continuous biological processes.",

Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus species, have gained attention because of their potential anticancer properties. This study investigated the anticancer and cytotoxic effects of postbiotic mediators (PMs) derived from Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PMs were prepared by culturing LGG and LR strains and isolating the supernatant. The MTT assay assessed cell viability on ALL Jurkat cells and PBMCs, and apoptosis analysis was conducted using flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR was also performed to analyze BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels. The results showed that PMs derived from LGG and LR significantly reduced cell viability in Jurkat cells (P0.05) but not PBMCs (P0.05). Apoptosis analysis revealed an increase in apoptotic cells after PMs treatment. Nevertheless, gene expression analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the treated and untreated groups in BAX, BCL-2, BCLX, FAS, and p27 gene expression levels (P0.05). Findings suggest that specific PMs derived from LGG and LR possess anticancer properties against ALL cells.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Five-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 5ARIs prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is important in prostate development. It has been suggested that 5ARIs can be used a chemopreventative agent for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of prostate cancer associated with 5ARI use among men with BPH. Methods: Using Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1992 to 2011 in UK, prostate cancer risk was retrospectively compared in men with a new diagnosis of BPH, with no history of prostate cancer who were treated with 5ARIs, to men treated with alpha blockers (ABs) and those given no pharmacological treatment. Incidence rate of prostate cancer was calculated by treatment group; the association between BPH treatment group and prostate cancer was estimated by a multivariate Cox model. Results: 77,494 men with newly diagnosed BPH were included. The crude incidence rate of prostate cancer was 892.4 cases per 100,000 person-years amongst those treated with 5ARIs, compared with 1209.0 and 1542.9 in those treated with ABs and untreated individuals, respectively. The HR adjusted for potential confounders was 0.79 (0.72-0.86) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.72 (0.66-0.79) for 5ARI vs untreated. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, adjusted HRs attenuated to 0.87 (0.79-0.97) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.97 (0.87-1.08) for 5ARI vs untreated. Conclusion: Among men diagnosed with BPH, we found evidence of lower risks of subsequent prostate cancer in those treated with 5ARIs, but this appeared to be driven by cases diagnosed within a year of BPH, possibly reflecting prevalent prostate cancers that were initially misdiagnosed. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, there was little evidence of a reduced prostate cancer risk in those taking 5ARIs.",

Nine qualitative studies and 22 surveys were included, mainly in breast and endometrial cancer. Women treated for breast or endometrial cancer and HCPs were mostly supportive of PIFU. Facilitators for PIFU included convenience, control over own health and avoidance of anxiety-inducing clinic appointments. Barriers included loss of reassurance from scheduled visits and lack of confidence in self-management. HCPs were supportive of PIFU but concerned about resistance to change, unsuitability of PIFU for some patients and costs.

Especially, such mechanical cues can alter cellular DNA transcription and give rise to a subpopulation of tumor cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs). These CSCs with stem-like properties are critical drivers of tumorigenesis, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Yet, the biophysical and molecular machinery underlying the emergence of CSCs in tumor remained unexplored. This work employed a two-dimensional micropatterned multicellular model to examine the impact of mechanical constraints arisen from geometric confinement on the emergence and spatial patterning of CSCs in GBM tumor. Our study identified distinct spatial distributions of GBM CSCs in different geometric patterns, where CSCs mostly emerged in the peripheral regions. The spatial pattern of CSCs was found to correspond to the gradients of mechanical stresses resulted from the interplay between the cell-ECM and cell-cell interactions within the confined environment. Further mechanistic study highlighted a Piezo1-RhoA-focal adhesion signaling axis in regulating GBM cell mechanosensing and the subsequent CSC phenotypic transformation. These findings provide new insights into the biophysical origin of the unique spatial pattern of CSCs in GBM tumor and offer potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions.",

Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed followed by protein-protein interaction network of differentially expressed genes. About 1181 differentially expressed genes were identified from the microarray databases. Gene Ontology analyses indicated that these differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in mRNA splicing via spliceosome, neutrophil degranulation, peptide antigen assembly with MHC class II protein complex, and immunoglobulin production-mediated immune response. The most enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway terms of the 10 significant were Hematopoietic cell lineage.

This heterogeneous disease is currently broadly classified as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) positive luminal tumors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified tumors and triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Phytochemicals are proven to be promising anti-cancer chemotherapeutics agents with minimal cytotoxic effects on normal cells. Plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1, 4-naphthoquinone) is a phytochemical derived from the roots of Plumbago zeylanica and it is known to possess anti-cancer properties similar to other compounds of naphthoquinones. In about 90% of cancer cells, the telomerase enzyme activity is revived to add telomeric repeats to evade apoptosis. In this study, a combinatorial approach of combining the anti-cancer compound plumbagin to induce genotoxicity and a potent telomerase inhibitor, MST-312 (synthetic derivative of tea catechins), was used to determine the combinational treatment-induced lethality in breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-231 (TNBC) and MCF-7 (lumina) cells. MDA-MB-231 cells were responsive to combination treatment in both short-term (48 h) and long-term treatment (14 days) in a synergistic manner, whereas in MCF-7, the combination treatment was more effective in the long-term regimen. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of the plumbagin and MST-312 combination treatment were not recoverable after the short-term treatment. In conclusion, a combination treatment of MST-312 and plumbagin is proven to be more effective than a single plumbagin compound treatment in inducing DNA damage and telomere dysfunction leading to greater genome instability, cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death in cancer cells.",

        "AbstractText": "Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC), the metastatic spread of cancer to the leptomeninges, is a rare complication and has a dismal prognosis. Due to limited data available on LMC from India, we conducted a country-wise audit of LMC across 15 centres in India. The current study conducted in 2020, was a retrospective, multicentric audit of adult patients (aged \u226518 years) with diagnosis of LMC and who received treatment during 2010-2020. Baseline characteristics, details related to previous treatments, cancer sites, LMC diagnosis, treatment pattern and overall survival (OS) were collected. Descriptive statistics were performed, and Kaplan Meier analysis was performed for the estimation of OS. Among the patients diagnosed with LMC (n\u00a0=\u00a084), diagnosis was confirmed in 52 patients (61.9%) and 'probable' in 32 (38.1%) patients. The three most common cause of malignancy were non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer and gastrointestinal cancer with 45 (53.6%), 22 (26.1%) and 9 (10.7%) patients respectively. Intrathecal therapy was offered in 33 patients (39.3%). The most common intrathecal agent was methotrexate in 23 patients (27.4%). The median OS was 90 days (95% CI 48-128). Among tested variables, intrathecal therapy administration (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a00.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.68) and primary in lung (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.83) had a favourable impact on OS. Prognosis with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is poor with a significant burden of morbidity and mortality in India.

        "AbstractText": "Cancer survival data from Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCR) reflect the average outcome of patients in the population, which is critical for cancer control efforts. Despite decreasing incidence rates, cervical cancer is the second most common female cancer in India, accounting for 10% of all female cancers. The objective of the study is to estimate the five-year survival of patients with cervical cancer diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 from the PBCRs in India. A single primary incidence of cervical cancer cases of 11 PBCRs (2012-2015) was followed till June 30, 2021 (n\u00a0=\u00a05591). Active follow-ups were conducted through hospital visits, telephone calls, home or field visits, and public databases. Five-year Observed Survival (OS) and Age Standardised Relative Survival (ASRS) was calculated. OS was measured by age and clinical extent of disease for cervical cancers. The five-year ASRS (95% CI) of cervical cancer was 51.7% (50.2%-53.3%). Ahmedabad urban (61.5%; 57.4%-65.4%) had a higher survival followed by Thiruvananthapuram (58.8%; 53.1%-64.3%) and Kollam (56.1%; 50.7%-61.3%). Tripura had the lowest overall survival rate (31.6%; 27.2%-36.1%). The five-year OS% for pooled PBCRs was 65.9%, 53.5%, and 18.0% for localised, regional, and distant metastasis, respectively. We observed a wide variation in cervical cancer survival within India. The findings of this study would help the policymakers to identify and address inequities in the health system.

This study aims to depict the evolving landscape of cancer clinical trials in India by analysing the clinical trials registered in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI). We identified cancer trials registered in CTRI (between 2007 and 2021) using search terms adapted from the cancer types defined by the National Cancer Institute (USA). We then collated and analysed the publicly available information from CTRI (cancer subtypes, type of trial, treatment intent, type of intervention, sponsor type, recruitment countries) and used descriptive statistics to illustrate the overall as well as year-to-year trend. In total, we identified 1988 cancer trials, the majority of which focused on treating cancer (63%) and rest of the trials aimed at optimising the operational aspects of surgery (19%), mitigating treatment-related toxicity (10.6%), or treating cancer-related symptoms (7.8%). Focusing on trials with the intent of treating cancer, we found that most were investigating solid tumours as opposed to haematological malignancies with the most prominent cancer subtypes being breast cancer (17%), head and neck cancer (9.8%), lung cancer (9.6%), and cervical cancer (6.6%). The number of trials conducted in a given cancer subtype from our analysis overall correlated to the incidence, mortality, and 5-year prevalence of the respective cancer subtype in India; however, head and neck cancer and cervical cancer were underrepresented in trials as compared with the disease burden. The most common type of intervention was investigational drugs. The most common sponsor types were global pharmaceutical industry (26%) and research institution and hospital (26%). Despite a relatively high cancer burden, the availability of cancer trials in the Northeastern states of India was limited. There is a pressing need for clinical cancer research in India to be better aligned with the nation's healthcare needs and disease burden, focusing on prevalent and deadly cancers while ensuring the availability of clinical trials across geographic regions and underserved populations.

We compared the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab/becavizumab treatment in patients with unresectable HCC and various degrees of liver dysfunction. A total of 8 retrospective, non-randomized, cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis, for a total of 1,071 Child-Pugh A and 225 Child-Pugh B patients.

The INSIGHT study was an investigator-initiated, multi-site longitudinal cohort study conducted to reflect real-world epidemiology and clinical practice in Asia-Pacific in the immediate 7-year period after the conclusion of the BRIDGE study. Data were collected both retrospectively (planned 30% of the total cohort size) and prospectively (planned 70%) from January 2013 to December 2019 from eligible patients newly diagnosed with HCC from 33 participating sites across 9 Asia-Pacific countries. A total of 2,533 newly diagnosed HCC patients (1,052 in retrospective cohort and 1,481 in prospective cohort) were enrolled. The most common risk factor was hepatitis B in all countries except Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, where the prevalence of hepatitis C and diabetes were more common. The top three comorbidities reported in the INSIGHT study include cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes. We observe high heterogeneity in the first-line treatment recorded across countries and across disease stages, which significantly affects survival outcomes. Stratification by factors such as etiologies, tumor characteristics, the presence of extrahepatic metastases or macrovascular invasion, and the use of subsequent lines of treatment were performed. The INSIGHT study describes a wide spectrum of clinical management practices in HCC, where patient demographics, differential costs, and patient access to therapies may lead to wide geographical variations through the patient's treatment cycle, from diagnosis to clinical outcome. The high heterogeneity in patient outcomes demonstrates the need for more robust and clinical management strategies to be designed and adopted to bring about better patient outcomes.",

The triple-negative subtype, characterized by the absence of hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tends to occur in younger patients, be more aggressive and less differentiated. Furthermore, this subtype is considered the most immunogenic and associated with higher levels of tumor cell infiltration, mainly lymphocytes. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play a crucial role in the interaction of the host's immune system and cancer cells. The microenvironment is critical in tumor development and progression. Assessment of infiltrating lymphocytes can provide valuable information about the immune response and, given the lack of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and predict outcomes in triple-negative tumors and can be considered as a potential biomarker. Some evidence suggests that higher levels of these lymphocytes are associated with better responses to systemic treatment, longer progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). However, treatment escalation or de-escalation strategies for triple-negative BC (TNBC) currently do not consider the presence or density of TILs for therapeutic decisions. TILs appear to be useful predictive and prognostic indicators. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these relationships and integrate TILs as a biomarker consistently into clinical practice. This article summarizes key concepts relating to the role of the immune infiltrate in BC, along with the current status and future prospects regarding TILs as a predictive and prognostic biomarker.",

This study explored the acceptability of the proposed PROMPPT review to inform early intervention development. Interviews (n = 15) and an online discussion forum (n = 31) with patients prescribed opioids for PCNP and interviews with pharmacists (n = 13), explored acceptability of a proposed PROMPPT review. A prototype PROMPPT review was then tested and refined through 3 iterative cycles of in-practice testing (IPT) (n = 3 practices, n = 3 practice pharmacists, n = 13 patients). Drawing on the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA), a framework was generated (including a priori TFA constructs) allowing for deductive and inductive thematic analysis to identify aspects of prospective and experienced acceptability. Patients felt uncertain about practice pharmacists delivering the proposed PROMPPT review leading to development of content for the invitation letter for IPT (introducing the pharmacist and outlining the aim of the review). After IPT, patients felt that pharmacists were suited to the role as they were knowledgeable and qualified. Pharmacists felt that the proposed reviews would be challenging. Although challenges were experienced during delivery of PROMPPT reviews, pharmacists found that they became easier to deliver with time, practise and experience. Recommendations for optimisations after IPT included development of the training to include examples of challenging consultations.

        "AbstractText": "Chronic pain is associated with a poor health-related quality of life (HRQL). Whereas the prescription rate of opioids increased during the last decades, their use in chronic non-malignant pain remains unclear. However, there is currently no clinical consensus or evidence-based guidelines that consider the long-term effects of opioid therapy on HRQL in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. This systematic review aims to address the question of whether opioid therapy improves HRQL in patients with chronic non-malignant pain and provide some guidance to practitioners. PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched in June 2020 for double-blind, randomized trials (RCTs), comparing opioid therapy to placebo and assessed a HRQL questionnaire. The review comprises a qualitative vote counting approach and a meta-analysis of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), EQ-5D questionnaire and the pain interference scale of the Brief pain inventory (BPI). 35 RCTs were included, of which the majority reported a positive effect of opioids for the EQ-5D, the BPI and the physical component score (PCS) of the SF-36 compared to placebo. The meta-analysis of the PCS showed a mean difference of 1.82 [confidence interval: 1.32, 2.32], the meta-analysis of the EQ-5D proved a significant advantage of 0.06 [0.00, 0.12]. In the qualitative analysis of the mental component score (MCS) of the SF-36, no positive or negative trend was seen. No significant differences were seen in the MCS (MD: 0.65 [-0.43, 1.73]). A slightly higher premature dropout rate was found in the opioid group (risk difference: 0.04 [0.00, 0.07], p = .07). The body of evidence is graded as low to medium. Opioids have a statistically significant, but small and clinical not relevant effect on the physical dimensions of HRQL, whereas there is no effect on mental dimensions of HRQL in patients with chronic non-malignant pain during the initial months of treatment. In clinical practice, opioid prescriptions for chronic non-cancer pain should be individually assessed as their broad efficacy in improving quality of life is not confirmed. The duration of opioid treatment should be determined carefully, as this review primarily focuses on the initial months of therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Lenvatinib is indicated for the forefront treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC), but its use may be limited by the risk of esophagogastric varices (EGV) bleeding. This study assessed the prevalence, predictors, and complications of EGV in aHCC patients treated with lenvatinib. In this multicenter international retrospective study, cirrhotic patients treated with lenvatinib for aHCC, were enrolled if upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy was available within 6 months before treatment. Primary endpoint was the incidence of EGV bleeding during lenvatinib therapy; secondary endpoints were predictors for EGV bleeding, prevalence, and risk factors for the presence of EGV and high-risk EGV at baseline, as well as impact of EGV bleeding on patients' survival. 535 patients were enrolled in the study (median age: 72 years, 78% male, 63% viral etiology, 89% Child-Pugh A, 16% neoplastic portal vein thrombosis [nPVT], 56% Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C): 234 had EGV (44%), 70 (30%) were at high risk and 59 were on primary prophylaxis. During lenvatinib treatment, 17 patients bled from EGV (3 grade 5), the 12-month cumulative incidence being 3%. The only baseline independent predictor of EGV bleeding was the presence of baseline high-risk EGV (hazard ratio: 6.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.23-21.57, p = 0.001). In these patients the 12-month risk was 17%.

        "AbstractText": "Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. So far, standard systemic therapy for advanced iCCA has been a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. However, recent advancements in the understanding of the molecular characteristics of iCCA have opened new possibilities for molecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Reportedly, 9-36% of iCCA cases have an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment (TME) based on the immune gene expression signature, which is characterized by the presence of immune cells involved in anti-tumor immune responses. The majority of iCCA cases have a non-inflamed TME with a lack of effector T cells, rendering immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ineffective in these cases. Interestingly, alterations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR2) gene and IDH1/2 gene mutations are often observed in the non-inflamed TME in iCCA. Several mechanisms have been reported for the role of driver mutations on the establishment of TME unique for iCCA. For example, IDH1/2 mutations, which cause an increase in DNA methylation, are associated with the downregulation and hypermethylation of antigen processing and presentation machinery, which may contribute to the establishment of a non-inflamed TME. Therefore, inhibitors targeting IDH1/2 may restore the DNA methylation and expression status of molecules involved in antigen presentation, potentially improving the efficacy of ICIs. FGFR inhibitors may also have the potential to modulate immunosuppressive TME by inhibitingthe suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and activating the interferon-\u03b3 signaling as a consequence of inhibition of the FGFR signal. From this perspective, understanding the molecular characteristics of iCCA, including the TME and driver mutations, is essential for the effective application of ICIs and molecular-targeted therapies. Combination approaches that target both the tumor and immune system hold promise for improving the outcomes of patients with iCCA. Further research and clinical trials are needed to validate these approaches and optimize the treatment strategies for iCCA.",

This study aimed to identify preoperative predictive factors for MVI in HCC and further evaluate oncologic outcomes of different types and extents of hepatectomy according to stratified risk of MVI. Patients with surgically resected single HCC (\u22645 cm) who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in a single-center retrospective study. Two radiologists reviewed the images with no clinical, pathological, or prognostic information. Significant predictive factors for MVI were identified using logistic regression analysis against pathologic MVI and used to stratify patients. In the subgroup analysis, long-term outcomes of the stratified patients were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and compared between anatomical and nonanatomical or major and minor resection. A total of 408 patients, 318 men and 90 women, with a mean age of 56.7 years were included. Elevated levels of tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein [\u03b1-FP] \u226525 ng/mL and PIVKA-II \u226540 mAU/mL) and three MRI features (tumor size \u22653 cm, non-smooth tumor margin, and arterial peritumoral enhancement) were independent predictive factors for MVI. As the MVI risk increased from low (no predictive factor) and intermediate (1-2 factors) to high-risk (3-4 factors), recurrence-free and overall survival of each group significantly decreased (p = 0.001). In the high MVI risk group, 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was significantly lower in patients who underwent major compared to minor hepatectomy (26.6 vs. 59.8%, p = 0.027). Tumor markers and MRI features can predict the risk of MVI and prognosis after hepatectomy. Patients with high MVI risk had the worst prognosis among the three groups, and major hepatectomy improved long-term outcomes in these high-risk patients.",

However, direct comparison with other combination treatments including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) + tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are lacking. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to indirectly compare the efficacy and the safety of first-line systemic therapies for unresectable advanced HCC. A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to October 31, 2022. Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing TKIs, including sorafenib and lenvatinib, or ICIs reporting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were included. Individual survival data were extracted from OS and PFS curves to calculate restricted mean survival time. A Bayesian NMA was performed to compare treatments in terms of efficacy (15- and 30-month OS, 6-month PFS) and safety, represented by grade \u22653 (severe) adverse events (SAEs). The incremental safety-effectiveness ratio as measure of net health benefit was calculated as the difference in SAE probability divided by survival difference between the 2 most effective treatments. Nine RCTs enrolling 6,600 patients were included. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the highest probability (88%) of achieving the 30-month OS landmark. Lenvatinib showed a probability of 86% of achieving best PFS outcomes. ICI monotherapies ranked as most tolerable. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab showed the best net health benefit for OS, compared to durvalumab plus tremelimumab. When evaluating the net health benefit for PFS, at a willingness-to-risk threshold of 10% of SAEs for life-month gained, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was favoured in 78% of cases, while at threshold of 30% of SAEs for life-month gained, lenvatinib was favoured in 76% of cases. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is the best treatment in terms of net benefit and therefore it should be recommended as standard of care. Compared to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, lenvatinib monotherapy had the best net benefit for PFS when physicians and patients are available to accept a higher risk of toxicity.",

This investigation sought to elucidate the effect of liver fibrosis severity on the cancer-specific prognosis. A total of 524 consecutive patients were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were compared according to fibrosis stage. Moreover, postoperative outcomes were subjected to analysis in cohorts of patients with F0 and F1-3, as well as in those with F1-3 and F4, who were carefully matched for background factors. The 5-year RFS exhibited a significantly worse outcome in the F4 group compared to other stages of fibrosis: 5-year RFS - F0 (46.6%), F1-3 (33.1%), and F4 (23.5%), p = 0.03 (F0 vs. F1-3) and p < 0.01 (F1-3 vs. F4). Additionally, the 5-year DSS also presented a significantly worse prognosis in the F4 group: 5-year DSS - F0 (82.9%), F1-3 (73.6%), and F4 (57.4%), p = 0.04 (F0 vs. F1-3) and p < 0.01 (F1-3 vs. F4).

After matched analysis, both RFS and DSS exhibited significantly worse prognoses in the presence of more advanced fibrosis. There was a significantly higher incidence of multiple recurrences in the F4 group than the F1-3 group, and a number of recurrences were observed both in the same hepatic segment as the resected side and in the contralateral lobe in F4 group. The hazard and recurrence pattern of HCC signifies that the prognosis could potentially be poor, as the hepatic fibrosis likely owing to a higher hepatocarcinogenic potential, even in the absence of progression to cirrhotic condition.

Whole-genome sequencing was performed using isolated cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from aqueous humor of 3 retinoblastoma patients. We analyzed genomic copy number and mutational alterations, histologic and pathologic features, and clinical data. The most common genetic alteration identified in these three retinoblastoma cases was a focal MYCN amplification on 2p. All tumors showed an early age of diagnosis with a median of 9 months. The tumor histopathologic features included neovascularization and subretinal seeding in case 1, diffuse nature with choroidal and prelaminar optic nerve invasion in case 2, and complete vitreous seeding in case 3. Case 1 expressed RB protein and had no RB1 mutation, case 2 did not express RB protein and had an RB1 mutation, and case 3 did not express RB protein and likely had an epigenetic effect on RB expression. Our report shows 3 cases of unilateral retinoblastomas diagnosed in patients ranging from 4 months to 18 months old. Genomic analysis from AH cfDNA revealed MYCN amplification with intact RB protein staining in case 1 and lack of RB staining in cases 2 and 3. RB1 mutational analysis in the AH confirmed a pathogenic variant in case 2. Clinical pathology showed features requiring aggressive treatment, specifically enucleation. MYCN-amplified retinoblastomas demonstrate unique pathogenesis and aggressive behavior, regardless if MYCN is a primary or secondary driver of disease. Genomic analysis from aqueous humor may be useful when deciding to enucleate as opposed to treating conservatively. Focal MYCN amplification on 2p might be relevant for tumor growth in this subset of the retinoblastoma population in terms of targeted therapeutics.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiation treatment is the favored alternative for mastectomy in patients with breast cancer. To allow for breast conservation in patients with large invasive tumors and poor response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) or patients with extensive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), oncoplastic breast conserving surgery (OPBCS) techniques are introduced. OPBCS allows for breast conservation in a selective group of breast cancer patients who initially would have been treated with mastectomy due to the unfavorable tumor-to-breast ratio. With OPBCS, the oncological tumor excision is combined with plastic surgical breast conservation techniques without compromising oncological safety and maintaining aesthetic outcomes by preserving the shape of the breast. OPBCS should however not be applied to all breast cancer patients and the selection of patients who benefit from OPBCS and the timing of OPBCS are best discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Caution is required in patients with higher risk of positive margins [e.g., multifocal breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), larger tumors and DCIS]. In these patients, delayed OPBCS is recommended to facilitate re-excision and maintain excellent breast conserving rates. Despite proven benefits in selected patients, the increase in the adoption of OPBCS is relatively low. This article provides a clinical perspective on OPBCS.",

        "AbstractText": "Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker for predicting prognosis and effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer. The emergence of novel HER2 antibody-drug conjugate has led to a shift from the binary categorization of HER2 status (i.e., negative and positive) to a ternary categorization gradually (i.e., HER2 0, HER2 low expression and HER2 positive). The heterogeneity of HER2 low expression in breast cancer has also recently aroused widespread concern, and the heterogeneity of tumors has led to differences in the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify the HER2 expression status of breast cancer, which can provide a basis for patients to formulate personalized treatment strategies. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and been widely used in the pathological accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. The research results show that AI can significantly improve the consistency and accuracy of HER2 interpreted by pathologists in breast cancer. This has provoked many discussions on HER2-low breast cancer, such as quality control prior to HER2-low expression detection, the latest progress of tumor heterogeneity, and the application of AI. In this paper, we discuss the latest testing guidelines and advances on HER2-low breast cancer, aiming to standardize and improve the pathological testing of HER2-low breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women, accounting for approximately 30% of all new cancer cases. The prognosis of breast cancer heavily depends on the stage of diagnosis, with early detection resulting in higher survival rates. Various risk factors, including family history, alcohol consumption and hormone exposure, contribute to breast cancer development. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of certain receptors, is particularly aggressive and heterogeneous. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), abnormal dilations of small blood vessels in the brain, is contributed by mutated genes like CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 through the perturbed formation of the CCM signaling complex (CSC). The CSC-non-classic membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs)-progesterone (PRG) (CmP)/CSC-mPRs-PRG-classic nuclear progesterone receptors (nPRs) (CmPn) signaling network, which integrates the CSC with mPRs and nPRs, plays a role in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Understanding these pathways can provide insights into potential treatments. This paper focuses on the emerging field of CmPn/CmP signal networks, which involve PRG, its receptors (nPRs and mPRs), and the CSC. These networks play a role in tumorigenesis, particularly in TNBCs. Aims to deliver a thorough examination of the CmP/CmPn pathways concerning TNBCs, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of these pathways, explores their applications and highlights their significance in the context of TNBCs.",

        "AbstractText": "The ACE study previously demonstrated that tucidinostat (chidamide), a subtype-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, plus exemestane significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer patients with a manageable safety profile. The analysis of long-term safety and overall survival (OS) is presented here. ACE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial comparing tucidinostat 30 mg/twice weekly plus exemestane 25 mg/day versus placebo plus exemestane 25 mg/day in postmenopausal patients with advanced, HR+ breast cancer. The primary endpoint was PFS, and OS was the secondary endpoint. Of the 365 patients enrolled between July 2015, and June 2017, 244 were assigned to tucidinostat plus exemestane (tucidinostat group) and 121 to placebo plus exemestane group (placebo group). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups. The median follow-up from randomization to data cut-off (February 25, 2021) of this analysis was 26.5 months (range, 13.9-45.5 months). A total of 231 deaths (63.3%) from 365 patients occurred, including 155 deaths (63.5%) in the tucidinostat group and 76 deaths (62.8%) in the placebo group. The median OS was 30.3 months (95% CI, 26.7-36.7) in the tucidinostat group and 30.3 months (95% CI, 24.8-38.1) in the placebo group. The safety profiles of both tucidinostat and placebo groups remained consistent with those previously reported, and no new safety signals were observed with longer follow-up. Neutropenia of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 51.6% of the patients in the tucidinostat group and 2.5% of the patients in the placebo group. Adverse events (AEs) that led to treatment discontinuations from any cause occurred in 28 (11.5%) patients in the tucidinostat group and 4 (3.3%) in the placebo group. Although tucidinostat in combination with exemestane had produced a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint PFS, the ACE study did not show a prolongation of the secondary endpoint OS in the tucidinostat combination regimen. Ongoing studies have been considered in terms of potential identification of what patient subpopulations could benefit most from the tucidinostat combination regimens in advanced HR+ breast cancer.",

        "AbstractText": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor to invasive breast cancer. However, if left untreated, about 50% of DCIS progress. Preventing such a progression is of paramount importance. Cumulative evidence indicated that the mevalonate cascade, the core of cholesterol biosynthesis, contributes to the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway providing the isoprenoids required for GTPase activation, the nuclear accumulation of the Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) coactivator, and the subsequent gene transcription and that the disruption of this cooperation associated with tumor progression. In this in silico study, we investigated whether such a disruption occurred already during the transformation of the normal mammary epithelium into DCIS. To this aim, we interrogated a publicly available dataset, and we explored the interrelationship of the genes involved in the de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and the association with those coding for the core components of the Hippo signaling pathway in a set of patient-matched samples of DCIS and corresponding histologically normal (HN) epithelium. Most genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were more expressed in DCIS than in the corresponding HN epithelium. This differential expression was associated with a substantial change in their correlation profile. In particular, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR) and INSIG1 lost the positive association shown in the HN epithelium, and their negative association with LSS switched to a positive one. Also, GGPS1, which plays a crucial role in isoprenoids production, significantly changed its correlation profile. The positive association between GGPS1 and HMGCR or INSIG1 disappeared, whereas the positive association with SQLE, which drives the irreversible commitment to cholesterol, switched to a negative one in DCIS. Present findings corroborated the hypothesis that a dysfunctional mevalonate pathway possibly concurs with DCIS development by leading to abnormal production of isoprenoids, which in turn activate GTPases and promote YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation, and suggested the safe and low-cost treatment with statins as the possible winning strategy to contrast this metabolic dysfunction.",

By May 2020, she developed recurrence of the left breast mass with metastases in liver, bone and lymph nodes. She then received pyrotinib plus trastuzumab and nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy. Both the left breast mass and liver metastases showed noticeable improvement, with the disease evaluated as partial response (PR).

A combination regimen of pyrotinib retention plus inetetamab and vinorelbine were administered as second-line anti-HER2 therapy, and the brain metastases visibly shrunk, leading to PR, with the extracranial lesions remaining stable. Ultimately, due to brain lesions progression, the treatment was transitioned to trastuzumab deruxtecan. We applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to illustrate the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapy and minimal residual disease (MRD) to detect the disease status.

Preclinical studies suggest perioperative opioid use, defined here as opioids used in the setting of operative pain, may be linked to inferior oncologic outcomes. If this were true, opioid minimization strategies for surgical patients may reduce opioid-related deaths in more than one way. This review aims to describe the association between perioperative opioid use and breast cancer recurrence. On November 1, 2021, we searched the Ovid and EMBASE databases for the terms \"breast neoplasm\", \"opioid analgesics\", \"neoplasm recurrence\", and \"neoplasm metastasis\". Of the 350 articles retrieved, 11 met our inclusion criteria. The review was undertaken using the enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) checklist for quality. Clinical studies report no clear association between perioperative opioid use and local or distant breast cancer recurrence. Mixed results were found when assessing perioperative opioid use and overall survival. Multiple studies paradoxically found opioid use to be associated with lower recurrence rates, despite higher mortality rates. Most studies showed no difference in recurrence or survival in breast cancer surgery patients who did or did not receive opioid-containing analgesia, although most findings were limited by study design and low event rates in patients with breast cancer. The lack of a clear connection between perioperative opioid use and breast cancer recurrence contradicts some preclinical data, which describes mechanisms through which opioids upregulate tumor proliferation which might worsen oncologic outcomes. Existing clinical literature is limited to mostly retrospective studies in patients with predominantly early-stage breast cancers, with low event rates. Given the worsening opioid epidemic and preclinical study findings, opioid minimization strategies should still be explored. Future work should be prospective and examine cancer recurrence in high-risk patients with more advanced tumor pathologies.",

Patients with DLBCL clustered into three distinct immunotypes according to MDSC levels and subtype predominance: M-MDSChigh, PMN-MDSChigh, and MDSClow. The M-MDSChigh immunotype was associated with the germinal center B cell-like (GCB) subtype and elevated serum IL-8 and MIP-1\u03b1 levels. PMN-MDSChigh was associated with the non-GCB subtype and elevated IL-8, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1Ra levels.

This cross-sectional study was used to investigate a potential link between pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of surgical site infections in patients undergoing oral cavity oncology surgery. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary center in northwestern India from May 2022 to May 2023. Patients scheduled to undergo oral cavity oncology surgery during this period were eligible for inclusion. Patients with complete pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels and documented post-operative wound infection status were included in the analysis. A total of 85 patients who underwent oral cavity oncology surgery were included in the study. Among them, 30.58% (26 patients) had pre-operative vitamin D deficiency, The overall incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was 36.47% (31 patients). Among the patients with pre-operative vitamin D deficiency, 23 (88.5%) developed surgical site infections. Finally, pre-operative levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, pre-operative poor oral hygiene, and low albumin were confirmed as statistically significant independent predictors of SSI. After doing multivariate analysis, vitamin D deficiency was found to be a significant predictor of post-op wound infection [adjusted odds ratio\u2009-\u20090.71 (95% CI 0.61-0.82); p value\u2009<\u20090.001]. This study highlights the significant association between pre-operative 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk of surgical site infections in patients. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in modulating the immune response, promoting antimicrobial peptides, and enhancing wound healing. These findings support the importance of assessing and addressing vitamin D deficiency in patients scheduled for oral cavity oncology surgery to potentially reduce the incidence of SSIs.",

        "AbstractText": "Urinary bladder carcinoma is a disease of the elderly and often presents at an advanced stage due to ignorance and manifestation of symptoms at later stages of the disease. In India, very little data is available regarding the clinico-epidemiological pattern of urinary bladder cancers. In this study, we analysed the clinico-demographic profile of patients with urinary bladder carcinoma, attending a tertiary care centre in Eastern India over the last 5\u00a0years. We analysed the database of Oncology OPD of a tertiary care centre in West Bengal in Eastern India and collected the demographic, clinical and treatment data of urinary bladder carcinoma patients who attended our OPD between 2017 and 2021. The objective was to assess the demographic and clinical profile of these patients and compare them with those reported from other parts of India as well as the rest of the world. Majority of patients (70%) were above 50\u00a0years of age with a strikingly huge male predominance (male:female\u2009=\u20096.6:1). Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was the most common (90%) histology. 67.2% of the cases were muscle-invasive disease at presentation, and 19.3% of the patients presented with metastatic disease with bone (42%) as the most common site of metastasis. Overall, around 22% of patients underwent surgery either with definitive or palliative intent. Sixty-five percent of the patients who received radiotherapy underwent definitive radiation as a part of bladder preservation protocol. Thirty-five percent of all patients received chemotherapy; most of them (50.5%) received chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment before definitive therapy. To conclude, it can be said that this study is one of its first from Eastern India and will act as a stepping stone for future studies concentrating on clinico-epidemiological profile, early diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma urinary bladder.",

The interaction between cancer cells and platelets is a well-established phenomenon. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a premalignant disorder with a malignant transformation rate of 2-8%. This study aimed to evaluate platelet parameters in OSMF and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in the background of OSMF. This cross-sectional study was performed using secondary data retrieved between January 2019 and December 2019 in the Department of Oral Pathology and the Hematology Laboratory. The data retrieved included 44 histopathologically proven OSCC in a background of OSMF (group III) and 36 OSMF (group II). The haematological parameters of these selected cases were retrieved from the Sysmex XN-1000 automated hematology analyser database. A control group (group I) comprises 50 subjects with normal (negative/unflagged) haematological parameters. All data were statistically analysed using SPSS 20.0. The significance level of tests was set at 5%.

Platelet parameters may be used as indices in the OSCC in the background of OSMF. However, large-scale prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the utility of these parameters during the malignant transformation of OSMF, thereby encouraging prompt treatment to prevent morbidity and mortality.",

The search included all the published articles (human case reports and case series) up till April 2023, with no time restrictions. OMSs were slightly more prevalent in males in their fifth to seventh decades of life. However, a high percentage of OMSs has been reported in the second decade of life. Lower extremities, breasts and uterus are the most common primary origin of metastatic sarcoma. Gingiva and mandible were common locations in the oral cavity for metastatic deposits. Generally, they demonstrated widespread affliction. The mean time interval between primary tumor detection and diagnosis of the oral metastasis was about 33.54 \u00b1 36.19 months. Death was reported in 83 patients (67.48 %) with a mean survival rate of 7.98 \u00b1 10.30 months. The most common microscopic tumor types were leiomyosarcoma (n = 21, 17 %), followed by angiosarcoma (n = 20, 16.26 %) and osteosarcoma (n = 18, 14.63 %). In conclusion, while oral metastases of sarcomas are not common, those should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the oral lesions. Although OMSs show a high occurrence in the 7th decade of the life, the average age of patients with oral involvement is lower than the overall metastatic lesions. OMSs may present as widespread disease with poor prognosis.",

This study assesses the influence of structural features of squaraine dyes on optoacoustic activity through computational models, in vitro testing, and in vivo experimentation. The squaraine scaffold was decorated with halogens and side-chain extensions. Extension of side chains and heavy halogenation of squaraines both increased optoacoustic signals individually, although they had a more significant effect in tandem. Density functional theory models suggest that the origin of the increased optoacoustic signal is the increase in transition dipole moment and vibrational entropy, which manifested as increased absorbance in near-infrared region (NIR) wavelengths and decreased fluorescence quantum yield. This study provides insight into the structure-function relationships that will lead guiding principles for optimizing optoacoustic contrast agents. Further developments of squaraines and other agents will further increase the relevance of optoacoustic imaging in a clinical setting.",

Clinical prediction models were developed to inform physician assessment of pretest probability of nodule malignancy but have not been validated in a high-risk cohort of nodules for which biopsy was ultimately performed. Do guideline-recommended prediction models sufficiently discriminate between benign and malignant nodules when applied to cases referred for biopsy by navigational bronchoscopy? We assembled a prospective cohort of 322 indeterminate pulmonary nodules in 282 patients referred to a tertiary medical center for diagnostic navigational bronchoscopy between 2017 and 2019. We calculated the probability of malignancy for each nodule using the Brock model, Mayo Clinic model, and Veterans Affairs (VA) model. On a subset of 168 patients who also had PET-CT scans before biopsy, we also calculated the probability of malignancy using the Herder model. The performance of the models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for each model. The study cohort contained 185 malignant and 137 benign nodules (57% prevalence of malignancy). The malignant and benign cohorts were similar in terms of size, with a median longest diameter for benign and malignant nodules of 15 and 16 mm, respectively. The Brock model, Mayo Clinic model, and VA model showed similar performance in the entire cohort (Brock AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; Mayo Clinic AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76; VA AUC, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.62-0.74). For 168 nodules with available PET-CT scans, the Herder model had an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85).

Adding an inlet structure prior to a nanochannel effectively improved the DNA capture rate by 190 - 700 % relative to that for the abrupt micro/nanochannel interface. The capture of DNA from the microchannel to various inlets was determined mainly by the capture volumes of the inlet structures and the geometrically modified electric field in the inlet structure. However, as the width of the inlet structure increased, the hydrodynamic flow existing in the microchannel negatively influenced the DNA capture by dragging some DNA molecules deep into the inlet structure back to the microchannel.

Our study used LC-MS untargeted metabolomic approaches and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to characterize the molecular changes induced by a specific moderate uniaxial stretch regimen (i.e., 24\u00a0h-1\u00a0Hz, cyclic stretch 0,5% elongation) on SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. Differential metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the mechanical stimulation induces a downregulation of both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. At the same time, the amino acid metabolism was found to be dysregulated, with the mechanical stimulation enhancing glutaminolysis and reducing the methionine cycle. Our findings showed that cell metabolism and oxidative defense are tightly intertwined in mechanically stimulated cells. On the one hand, the mechano-induced disruption of the energy cell metabolism was found correlated with an antioxidant glutathione (GSH) depletion and an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, we showed that a moderate stretch regimen could disrupt the cytoprotective gene transcription by altering the expression levels of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD1), Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) genes. Interestingly, the cyclic applied strain could induce a cytotoxic sensitization (to the doxorubicin-induced cell death), suggesting that mechanical signals are integral regulators of cell cytoprotection. Hence, focusing on the mechanosensitive system as a therapeutic approach could potentially result in more effective treatments for osteosarcoma in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a disorder in which the clinical signs and symptoms of osteomalacia and the biochemical abnormalities of hypophosphatemia, phosphaturia, and low serum levels of 1,25(OH)2 Vitamin D3 are secondary to a neoplasm. A 33-year-old woman presented with musculoskeletal pain and proximal myopathy with a duration of 2.5 years which was treated with Vitamin D supplements. On the basis of the biochemical tests and histopathology, she was reevaluated and found to have TIO secondary to a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. The tumor was resected (limb salvage with endoprosthesis), and she had no pain or weakness at followup. The case reminds the readers to consider the possibility of TIO when evaluating patients with isolated hypophosphatemia, which may lead to long-term disability and prolonged morbidity if untreated. Early recognition and diagnosis of TIO is crucial since resection of the tumor usually reverses its manifestations.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Relationship Between Airway Examination with LEMON Criteria and Difficulty of Tracheal Intubation with IDS Criteria.",
        "AbstractText": "Tracheal intubation is a common technique used to secure a patient's airway, which is crucial in anesthesia. Successful tracheal intubation depends on various factors, including the assessment of the patient's airway before the procedure. In recent years, scoring systems, such as LEMON (an acronym for the assessment of the airway's appearance, identification of any dental issues, evaluation of Mallampati classification, assessment of airway obstruction, and examination of neck mobility) and intubation difficulty scale (IDS) have gained attention. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the LEMON criteria and IDS in tracheal intubation. The goal was to provide valuable insights that can assist medical professionals in optimizing their approach to airway management by analyzing clinical data, assessing patient outcomes, and evaluating the consistency between these scoring systems. This study was based on a descriptive-analytical study involving a group of patients requiring intubation. This study examined 105 patients scheduled for elective surgeries, aged between 19 and 60 years, without specific underlying diseases, such as laryngeal cancer, temporomandibular joint stiffness, or significant tongue enlargement, and with a body mass index (BMI) below 40 kg/m\u00b2. Initially, expert anesthesiologists assessed the patients using the LEMON criteria, and then the degree of intubation difficulty was measured using the IDS scoring system. Finally, these two criteria were compared. In this study, there was a significant correlation between the LEMON score and the IDS score (P < 0.001). The difficult intubation group (IDS score higher than 0) had higher LEMON scores (with the highest score equal to 4) than the non-difficult intubation group (IDS score of 0) (P = 0.017). The average LEMON and IDS scores were 3.11 and 1.35, respectively. Among the participants, 96.2% had an intubation difficulty score of \u2264 5; nevertheless, 3.8% had a score of > 5. Additionally, limited neck mobility emerged as the sole independent predictor of intubation difficulty (P = 0.002, odds ratio = 6.152). The LEMON score is associated with difficult intubation in adult patients requiring intubation.",

However, the impact of these changes on the profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains uncertain. Therefore, we determined the temporal trends in the etiologies of HCC in Egypt over a decade. We retrospectively analyzed data from consecutive patients who were diagnosed with HCC over 10 years (2010-2020) in a large center in Upper Egypt. Standard tests were utilized to diagnose hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus. In the absence of other liver disorders, the presence of obesity, or diabetes in the absence of other risk factors, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) was diagnosed. A total of 1,368 HCC patients were included, in which 985 (72%) had HCV, 58 (4%) had hepatitis B virus, and 143 (10.5%) had MAFLD, 1 patient had hemochromatosis, 1 had autoimmune liver disease, and 180 (13%) patients were with unknown cause. The annual proportions of MAFLD-related HCC were increased significantly between 8.3% in 2010 and 20.6% in 2020 ( p \u2009=\u20090.001), while HCV-related HCC declined from 84.8 to 66.7% ( p \u2009=\u20090.001). Throughout the study period, there were significant increases in the age at diagnosis of HCC, the proportion of female patients, obesity, diabetes, and less severe liver dysfunction at diagnosis ( p \u2009<\u20090.05 for all). With the decline of HCV, MAFLD is becoming a major cause of HCC in Egypt, which has increased substantially over the past 10 years.

There are no reports that depict the differences in outcomes in cancer patients between the two waves of the pandemic. This is a real-world experience aimed at characterizing the differences in demographics, clinical features, treatment details, and outcomes in COVID-19-positive cancer patients between the two pandemic waves. This was a prospective study of all COVID-19-positive cancer patients attending our specialty out-patient department at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre between March 2020 and November 2020 (1st wave) and April 2021 and June 2021 (second wave). All patients diagnosed to have COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with a biopsy-proven solid organ malignancy attending the medical oncology out-patient department were included during both the waves. A total of 300 patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection by either RT-PCR or cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test were encountered, of which 123 were encountered during the first wave of the pandemic and 177 during the second wave. The case fatality rate of the first wave was 9.8%, with a 15-day case fatality rate of 5.6%, whereas for the second wave, it was 13% and 7.2%, respectively. Twelve patients succumbed to COVID-19 disease in the first wave and 23 succumbed in the second. There were no statistically significant correlations; however, the death in the second wave tended to occur more in younger male patients, with comorbidities and history of smoking. There was no relation with ongoing cancer-directed treatment or chemotherapy. Our study is unique in comparing characteristics of the two most important COVID-19 waves and treatment patterns in cancer patients from a single center. The second wave showed a higher CFR, hospital admission rate, and higher frequency of respiratory complications; however, there was no relation to cancer-directed therapy and COVID-19, thus reiterating the fact that cancer treatment should not be halted in the event of a COVID-19 infection.",

The study was planned as a randomized, double-blind trial. In part A, a total of 117 mCRC patients were intended to receive 5\u2009mg/kg of bevacizumab every 2 weeks along with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy for a maximum of 18 cycles. In part B, 60 NSCLC patients were to receive 15\u2009mg/kg of bevacizumab every 3 weeks along with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the initial four cycles, followed by pemetrexed for another four cycles. The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in both subparts. The anticipated sample size was 106 evaluable mCRC patients to achieve 85% statistical power for concluding noninferiority with a margin of half the difference (18.8%) between DRL_BZ and Avastin, along with a pilot study involving 60 evaluable NSCLC patients. Safety comparison included assessing adverse events (AEs), infusion reactions, and lab abnormalities. Immunogenicity comparison involved the incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Pharmacokinetic comparison was planned after the first and fourth dosing cycles of treatment in 24 NSCLC patients. The PFS6 for mCRC patients treated with DRL_BZ and RMP was 57.8% and 50% respectively, with a difference in efficacy of 7.8 (-8.7, 23.7). The PFS9 was 31.1% and 22.9%, with a difference of 8.2% (-6.9%, 22.9%). The objective response rate (ORR) for DRL_BZ and RMP was 28.8% and 22.4%, while the disease control rate (DCR) was 44.2% and 37.9% respectively. For NSCLC patients, the PFS6 was 44% and 45%, showing a difference of -1.0 (-4.2, 22.1). The ORR was 41.4% and 48.1%, and the DCR was 62.1% and 63%. The frequency, type, and severity of AEs were similar in both indications. Blood levels during the first and fourth dosing cycles exhibited comparable values. All NSCLC patients tested negative for ADA, while no mCRC patients on DRL_BZ tested positive for ADA. Low incidences of ADA (8%) and NAbs (4.0%) were reported in patients on RMP.

Magnetic resonance mammography (MRM) is a valuable complement to conventional methods for the early diagnosis of disease, thereby providing patients with a better prognosis. The number of unnecessary biopsies and repeated excisions in cases of indeterminate breast lesions detected on conventional imaging is high. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of MRM in the evaluation of indeterminate breast lesions [Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 3/4] found in conventional mammography and ultrasonography (USG), taking the histopathological examination (HPE) as the gold standard. Materials and methods: A total of 38 patients with conventional radiological imaging diagnosis of indeterminate breast lesions (BIRADS 3/4) were included in this study and evaluated using contrast-enhanced MRM according to the MR-BIRADS lexicon (5th edition). Morphological characteristics of lesions were evaluated to determine the probability of malignancy. Histopathology was kept as the gold standard for comparing all the statistical parameters. Results: There were a total of 40 lesions, 35 masses, and five nonmass enhancement (NME) available for evaluation out of the 38 patients. The sensitivity of margins to detect malignancy approached 100%; however, it had a slightly lower specificity of 66.67%. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed good diagnostic performance with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 85, 90, 89.47, 85.71, and 87.50%, respectively. Conclusion: The MRI has been shown to be useful as a problem-solving tool in breast cancer screening, clarifying indeterminate findings and avoiding unnecessary short follow-ups and percutaneous biopsies.

        "AbstractText": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a growing global health concern that can lead to liver disease and cancer. It is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver, unrelated to excessive alcohol consumption. Studies indicate that the gut microbiota-host crosstalk may play a causal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, with epigenetic modification serving as a key mechanism for regulating this interaction. In this review, we explore how the interplay between gut microbiota and the host epigenome impacts the development of NAFLD. Specifically, we discuss how gut microbiota-derived factors, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate the DNA methylation and histone acetylation of genes associated with NAFLD, subsequently affecting lipid metabolism and immune homeostasis. Although the current literature suggests a link between gut microbiota and NAFLD development, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying this crosstalk remains limited. Therefore, more comprehensive epigenomic and multi-omic studies, including broader clinical and animal experiments, are needed to further explore the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to NAFLD-associated genes. These studies are anticipated to improve microbial markers based on epigenetic strategies and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD, ultimately addressing a significant unmet clinical need.",

APOBEC1 (A1) catalyzes the conversion of C-to-U in RNA, which is important in regulating cholesterol metabolism through its editing activity on ApoB mRNA. However, A1 requires a cofactor to form an \"editosome\" for RNA editing activity.

SYNCRIP is another RNA-binding protein that has been reported as a potential regulator of A1, although it is not directly involved in A1 RNA editing activity. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel cofactor, RBM46 (RNA-Binding-Motif-protein-46), that can facilitate A1 to perform C-to-U editing on ApoB mRNA.

We aimed to determine the effect of antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) with voriconazole (VCZ) on the need for cCT scans in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to eliminate pulmonary IFIs during chemotherapy. We retrospectively screened all patients' data from their electronic charts.

Ninety-six children were diagnosed before February 2013 and did not receive primary AFP and 146 children were administered VCZ following a diagnosis of ALL. There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. A total of 128 cCTs had been required in 62 children in the NoP group, compared with 64 cCTs in 52 children in the AFP group.

        "AbstractText": "Growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) correlates with worse outcome of many tumours and any cause mortality. Data about its role in lymphoproliferative neoplasms (LPN) are scarce. Our research aimed to reveal the correlation between GDF-15 and standard laboratory parameters of LPN activity, and to get insight into the possible value of this cytokine assessment in lymphoma patients. Prospective research included 40 patients treated for aggressive or indolent LPN, and 31 with indolent LPN on \"watch and wait\" regimen. Analyses were performed before and after treatment in treated patients and on two separate occasions in the \"watch and wait\" group. ELISA technique with R&D assays according to the manufacturer manual, from stored sera at\u2009-\u200970\u00a0\u00b0C was used for GDF-15 level measurement. Statistical analyses were performed by IBM SPSS Statistics 22 using descriptive and inferential statistics. As appropriate, differences between groups were assessed by two tailed t-test, Mann-Whitney or x2 test. Spearman Rank Order Correlation was done to correlate GDF-15 with standard laboratory markers of disease activity. All tests are two-tailed with significance level p < 0. 05. GDF-15 (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and fibrinogen (p\u2009=\u20090.001) concentrations increased after treatment in indolent lymphoma patients while \u03b22 microglobulin decreased (p < 0.001). GDF-15 positively correlated with \u03b22microglobulin before (p < 0.001) and after (p\u2009=\u20090.031) therapy. There were no differences in any of the aforementioned parameters in the \"watch and wait\" group during observation. A positive correlation between GDF-15 and \u03b22 microglobulin in patients with indolent LPN who need treatment suggests potential value in risk assessment.

Both karyotyping and i-FISH on mononuclear cell suspension are time, resource, and manpower-consuming assays. In this study, we have compared the results of specific leukemia-associated SCAs identified by i-FISH on air-dried bone marrow (BM)/peripheral blood (PB) smears and BM karyotyping. The study was conducted among pediatric patients (age\u2009\u2264\u200918 years) diagnosed with acute leukemias between January 2018 to December 2022. The results of i-FISH on air-dried BM/PB smears and BM-karyotyping for our SCA of interest (BCR::ABL1, ETV6::RUNX1, TCF3::PBX1, KMT2A rearrangement, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, CBFB::MYH11, and PML::RARA) were entered in a contingency table and the agreement of results was calculated. The strength of agreement was assessed by Cramer's V test. Among 270 patients, SCA of interest was identified among 26% and 17% of patients by i-FISH on air-dried smears and karyotyping, respectively. Excluding 53 patients with metaphase failure, the remaining 217 patients had 92% agreement (Cramer's V of 0.931 with p\u2009<\u20090.000) between the results for specific SCAs identified by both techniques. On excluding samples with cryptic cytogenetic aberrancies, there was 99% agreement (Cramer's V of 0.953 with p\u2009<\u20090.000) for gross SCA identified by both techniques. In addition, i-FISH on air-dried smears identified SCA in 30% of patients with metaphase failure. I-FISH on air-dried PB/BMA smears is a less-labor and\u00a0 resource-consuming assay. It can be considered an efficient alternative to conventional karyotyping for\u00a0 identifying specific SCA of interest in under-resourced laboratories.

Single-cell data analysis and cancer cell prediction were conducted using Seurat and CopyKAT package, respectively. Intercellular interactions were explored using CellPhoneDB and CellChat and subsequently validated using co-culture assays, ELISA and histological staining. We performed pathway activity analysis using gene set variation analysis and the Seurat package.

The deconvolution of the spatial transcriptomics data using the \"CARD\" package based on single-cell data. We successfully established the HCC-SDS mouse model. Twenty-nine clusters were identified. The interactions between cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were significantly enhanced via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling in HCC-SDS. CAFs recruited in HCC-SDS lead to ECM remodeling and the activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Deconvolution of the spatial transcriptome data revealed that CAFs physically surround cancer cells in HCC-SDS. This study reveals that the crosstalk of CAFs-cancer cells is crucial for the tumor-promoting effect of SDS. CAFs recruited by HCC via PDGFA may lead to ECM remodeling through activation of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, thereby forming a physical barrier to block immune cell infiltration under SDS.",

The secondary objective of the study are to enumerate the hysteroscopy findings in patients with AUB and to evaluate the pattern of AUB. Observational cross-sectional study among 60 women in reproductive and post-menopausal age group presenting with features/symptoms suggestive of abnormal uterine bleeding were studied. All patients reporting in the outpatient department (OPD) and who are eligible to participate were included in the study, after obtaining written informed consent. Detailed history, Clinical examination, Ultrasound pelvis and endometrial thickness assessment is done. Hysteroscopic findings were compared against histopathological findings. The various patterns of bleeding documented in our study population were menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, polymenorrhea, and post-menopausal bleeding. Out of these patterns, the commonest was menorrhagia at 50.0% and post-menopausal bleeding at 26.67%. In our study population, the various hysteroscopy findings were strawberry, tongue-shaped projections, pebble stones, polypoidal patterns, and cerebroid patterns. Out of these, the most common was a polypoidal pattern, strawberry pattern, and tongue-shaped projections with 45%, 31.67%, and 26.7%, respectively. The most common histopathology finding was secretory and proliferative constituting 35% and 26.67%, respectively. Carcinoma endometrium constitutes about 6.67% of the study population. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of strawberry appearance in hysteroscopy in comparison with secretory changes in histopathology were 52.38%, 79.49%, 57.89%, and 75.61%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of tongue-shaped projections appearance in hysteroscopy in comparison with HPE findings was 60%, 76.36%, 18.75%, and 95.45%, respectively.

People with AIS condition are genetically male, with XY karyotype in each cell, but their bodies are unable to respond to male sex hormones (called androgens). It is associated with infertility as well as developing cancerous conditions. The genetic association of CAIS involves polymorphism of genes such as NR5A1, SOX9, SRD5A2, CBX2, GATA4, and SRY. Their mutation and participation in genetics of CAIS can be studied by Single Nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis which is a way to detect genetic variations. SNP in coding region leads to synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Hence, this study highlights analysis of SNPs associated with CAIS. Our aim is to study SNP analysis of NR5A1, SOX9, SRD5A2, CBX2, GATA4, SRY genes in Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. SIFT and Polyphen analysis was performed for all the genes and samples were subjected for PCR-SSCP technique. SNPs were analyzed for the genes associated with CAIS. Benign and damaging SNPs were identified. DNA Samples were amplified using PCR technique and they will be analyzed using Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). As SNPs have decreased stability, damaging and benign character, they can be used as candidate hallmarks in study of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.",

A total of 121 PDAC patients who underwent radical resection, and who had an initial and single-organ metastasis to the liver, were analyzed. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival after recurrence (OSAR) were examined, and patients with all of these factors were defined as OLLM. The clinicopathological features and post-recurrent prognosis of OLLM patients were evaluated. In addition, a detailed analysis using the oligo-score, which was based on the prognostic factors, was performed. The prognostic analysis revealed that short recurrence-free interval (RFI) (<6\u2009months), short stable disease interval (SDI) (\u22643\u2009months), and four or more recurrent tumors were independent poor prognostic factors.

Several small-molecule moieties (FAPI-04, FAPI-46, etc.) are used for developing FAP-targeted theranostic agents. Nonetheless, the circulation time of FAP inhibitors is relatively short, resulting in rapid clearance via kidneys, low tumor uptake, and associated unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. To address the existing drawbacks, we engineered 3 peptides named FD1, FD2, and FD3 with different circulation times through solid-phase peptide synthesis. All the 3 reported peptides bind to human and murine FAP with single-digit nanomolar affinity measured by surface plasmon resonance. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the agents labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu was assessed in several tumor models exhibiting different levels of FAP expression. While radiolabeled FD1 was rapidly excreted from kidneys, radiolabeled FD2/FD3 have significantly prolonged circulation, increased tumor uptake, and decreased kidney accumulation. Our findings indicated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 positron emission tomography (PET) effectively detected FAP dynamics, whereas [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy in FAP-overexpressing tumor models, including pancreatic cancer cell models characterized by abundant stroma.

        "AbstractText": "Epidermal nevus sebaceous, commonly known as the nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, is a congenital sebaceous hamartoma. It typically manifests as a single yellowish plaque across the head and neck and is composed of sebaceous glands. It commonly occurs during infancy and grows during puberty. Usually, it follows a benign course; however, in a few cases, it can be malignant. This is the case of a 13-year-old child with verrucous plaques on the temple and scalp. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with a steadily developing hyperpigmented verrucous plaque on the scalp and ipsilateral side of his face. A dermoscopic examination revealed ridges and fissures in a cerebriform pattern with yellowish-gray globules and a papillary appearance. Physical examination and laboratory tests revealed no abnormalities. Biopsies were taken from the scalp and temple area, and the findings were consistent with the diagnosis of nevus sebaceous. The patient was referred to a plastic surgeon for a staged excision. We describe a unique example of a sebaceous nevus that affected the scalp and ipsilateral side of the face. As this hamartomatous growth carries the risk of cancer development, a dermatologist must identify the condition and begin treatment before malignant transformation occurs. This example of multiple verrucous plaques is an exception.",

The goal of this study was to provide clinicians with a reliable and beneficial source to understand gastric metastases arising from various primary tumors and to present the growing literature in an easily accessible form. Methods: Articles published in English language from implementation of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases until May 2022 were considered for the systematic review. Articles other than English language, letters to the editor, posters, and clinical images were excluded. Hematogenous and lymphogenic metastases were included whereas direct tumoral invasion and seeding were excluded. Articles and abstracts were analyzed and last selection was done after cross-referencing and by use of defined eligibility criteria. Results: In total 1,521 publications were identified and 170 articles were finally included totaling 186 patients with GM. The median age of patients was 62 years. Gynecologic cancer was the most common cancer type causing GM (67 patients), followed by lung cancer (33 patients), renal cancer (20 patients), and melanoma (19 patients). One of the main treatment methods performed for metastasis was resection surgery (n=62), sometimes combined with chemotherapy (ChT) or immunotherapy. ChT was the other most used treatment method (n=78). Also, immunotherapy was amongst the most preferred treatment options after surgery and ChT (n=10). Conclusions: As 172 case reports were screened in the systematic review from different journals, heterogeneity was inevitable. Some articles missed important information such as complete follow-up or clinical information. Moreover, since all of the included articles were case reports quality assessment could not be performed. Among 172 case reports reviewed, resection surgery was performed the most and was sometimes combined with ChT and immunotherapy. Further research about what type of treatment has the best outcomes for patients with gastric metastases is needed.",

        "AbstractText": "Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a group of rare, increasingly recognized, potentially reversible, noninfectious causes of unexplained encephalitis. It affects any age-group and has a plethora of clinical presentations, the most common being the neuropsychiatric manifestation. The diagnosis of this entity at the right time and proper treatment with immunotherapy can save many lives. In this study, we describe the demographic profile, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and treatment of 42 patients with features of AIE. This is a prospective study where 42 cases were selected from a tertiary care center in Northwestern India. Patients with suspected AIE underwent detailed clinical assessment, routine blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study, and autoimmune profile in blood and CSF. Screening for malignancy was done in all patients with computer tomography (CT) thorax and abdomen and tumor markers. Among 42 patients, males, and females were almost equally affected. The mean age of onset was 31 years. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) Encephalitis was the commonest of all AIE (57%) followed by anti-leucine-rich glioma inactivated-1 (anti-LGI-1) related AIE (11.9%), anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (anti-CASPR2) related AIE (4.7%), and steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) related to antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody (2.3%). Neuropsychiatric manifestation is the commonest. The seizure was noted in around 72% of patients, the commonest in the anti-NMDAR group. Faciobrachial dystonic seizure (FBDS) was noted in all five anti-LG1-1 encephalitis patients. CSF abnormalities were seen in 33.3% of patients in the form of pleocytosis or raised protein, or both. MRI abnormality was seen in 52% of patients. EEG was abnormal in 10% of patients, and delta brush was noted in three anti-NMDAR patients. All patients received immunotherapy in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or pulse IV methylprednisolone (IVMPS), or both. Two patients nonresponsive to IVIg and IVMPS received rituximab. Almost all patients responded to immunotherapy. Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE), a potentially treatable immune-responsive entity, is a common neurological problem and may be an answer to a large number of cases having unexplained encephalitis. Good clinical acumen and knowledge are required for early diagnosis and treatment of this potentially reversible disorder. How to cite this article: Sharma B, Paul M, Bagaria AK.

        "AbstractText": "Dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN), a potent hepatotoxin, exerts carcinogenic effects and induces hepatic necrosis in experimental animals via CYP2E1 metabolic activation, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Protocatechuic acid (PCA), a plant-based simple phenolic compound and potent antioxidant, has been shown to affect the development of neoplasia in the rat liver and inhibit the initiation or progression phases of most cancers. In this study, the modulatory effects of PCA on DMN-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and selected phase I xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes were investigated in male Wistar rats. This study assessed biomarkers of hepatic injury (alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma- glutamyl transferase); oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide concentration, lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione levels); measured activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, sodium dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase); and inflammation (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin-1-Beta (IL-1\u03b2) and iNOS). The results of our investigation demonstrated that pretreatment with PCA at 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight p.o. reduced DMN (20 mg/kg bw) i.p. mediated hepatic injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the activities of phase I metabolizing enzymes were significantly induced except for aminopyrine-N-demethylase in the DMN-treated rats when compared with the DMN alone control group. This induction was also reversed by pre-treatment with PCA. The result of this study suggests that PCA is hepatoprotective against DMN-induced hepatic damage by its ability to suppress oxidative stress, inflammation, and modulate the activities of the selected phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Thus, PCA may prove useful in combating DMN-induced hepatic damage.",

Agreement with an expert consensus served as a surrogate standard of reference to estimate diagnostic accuracy. Polychoric correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations between diagnostic confidence and accuracy (=agreement with expert consensus). Uniformity to diagnose high-risk (\u2265cT3\u2009ab) versus low-risk (\u2264cT3\u2009cd) cT-stage, cN0 versus cN+, lateral nodes and tumour deposits, MRF and sphincter involvement, and solid versus mucinous tumours was high with IOA > 80% in the majority of cases (and >80% agreement with expert consensus).

        "AbstractText": "The irreversible and progressive atrophy by Alzheimer's Disease resulted in continuous decline in thinking and behavioral skills. To date, CNN classifiers were widely applied to assist the early diagnosis of AD and its associated abnormal structures. However, most existing black-box CNN classifiers relied heavily on the limited MRI scans, and used little domain knowledge from the previous clinical findings. In this study, we proposed a framework, named as PINet, to consider the previous domain knowledge as a Privileged Information (PI), and open the black-box in the prediction process. The input domain knowledge guides the neural network to learn representative features and introduced intepretability for further analysis. PINet used a Transformer-like fusion module Privileged Information Fusion (PIF) to iteratively calculate the correlation of the features between image features and PI features, and project the features into a latent space for classification. The Pyramid Feature Visualization (PFV) module served as a verification to highlight the significant features on the input images. PINet was suitable for neuro-imaging tasks and we demonstrated its application in Alzheimer's Disease using structural MRI scans from ADNI dataset. During the experiments, we employed the abnormal brain structures such as the Hippocampus as the PI, trained the model with the data from 1.5T scanners and tested from 3T scanners. The F1-score showed that PINet was more robust in transferring to a new dataset, with approximatedly 2% drop (from 0.9471 to 0.9231), while the baseline CNN methods had a 29% drop (from 0.8679 to 0.6154). The performance of PINet was relied on the selection of the domain knowledge as the PI. Our best model was trained under the guidance of 12 selected ROIs, major in the structures of Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe. In summary, PINet considered the domain knowledge as the PI to train the CNN model, and the selected PI introduced both interpretability and generalization ability to the black box CNN classifiers.",

LG was performed in 44 patients with GC between July 2015 to June 2022, in the Department of Surgical Oncology, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt, and we assessed the surgical outcomes of this approach as an initial experience of a single cancer center. Twenty-seven patients underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, and seventeen underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Two cases had combined resection. Operative time was 339.2 \u00b1 76.73 min, while blood loss was 153.86 \u00b1 57.51 mL. The patients were ambulant on postoperative day 0, oral intake was started within three days (range 1-5 days) and the hospital stay was six days (range 3-9 days).

There are only approximately 200 cases reported in the English literature to date. Histologically, it may be mistaken for spindle cell neoplasms such as gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Patients with AIHPS usually present with early satiety, abdominal fullness, postprandial vomiting, epigastric pain, and eructations. Adult intussusception is rare and only accounts for 5% of all intussusceptions. Gastroduodenal intussusception is one of the rare types of adult intussusception. This is more likely to occur when a benign or malignant stomach lesion acts as a lead point. We report a case of AIHPS in a 70-year-old lady presenting with gastroduodenal intussusception. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGDS) was performed, and it revealed a diffusely thickened and narrowed pyloric antrum. A contrasted computed tomography (CECT) of the thorax and abdomen showed a distended stomach with circumferential thickening of the pylorus. The pre-pyloric antrum was intussuscepting into the pylorus, and the apex is seen within the first part of duodenum. She underwent distal gastrectomy with a Roux-en-y reconstruction via laparoscopic approach and was discharged well. AIHPS is a rare condition and should be a differential in adults presenting with gastric outlet obstruction. We believe in cases of AIHPS presenting with gastroduodenal intussusception, a distal gastrectomy with reconstruction is a reasonable approach. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to obtain the best outcome.",

Positron emission tomography is a promising modality for detecting axillary lymph node metastasis. In addition, nomograms are used to predict the status of axillary lymph nodes.

The axillary maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) values of the patients in the preoperative period, the features in the perioperative and postoperative specimen and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram data were evaluated. As axillary SUVmax detected by Positron emission tomography in the preoperative period increased, so did the likelihood of lymph node involvement. Axillary SUVmax value were compared with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram data but no correlation was found. Age, lymph node number, histopathology results, mass diameter, presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion and/or perineural invasion, tumor type, estrogen receptor status, Ki67 and Cerb-B2 statuses were not correlated. However, axillary SUVmax was inversely correlated with grade and progesterone receptor status. Results from positron emission tomography of axillary lymph nodes in breasts cancer patients showed that SUVmax was only inversely related to cancer grade and progesterone receptor status while not correlating with other accepted parameters for tumor assessment.

        "AbstractText": "Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend definitive chemoradiation rather than surgery for patients with locally advanced clinical stage T3 and N2 (stage IIIB) lung cancer involving the chest wall. The data supporting this recommendation are controversial. We studied whether surgery confers a survival advantage over definitive chemoradiation in the National Cancer Database. We identified all patients with clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer in the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2017 who underwent a lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection and compared them with patients with clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer who had definitive chemoradiation. We used propensity score matching to minimize confounding by indication while excluding patients with tumors in the upper lobes to exclude Pancoast tumors. We used 1:1 propensity score matching and Kaplan-Meir survival analyses to estimate associations. Of 4467 patients meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, 210 (4.49%) had an en bloc chest wall resection. Patients undergoing surgical resection were younger (mean age\u00a0=\u00a060.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.3\u00a0years vs 67.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4\u00a0years; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and had more adenocarcinoma (59.0% vs 44.5%; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) but were otherwise similar in terms of sex (37.1% female vs 42.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.167) and race (Whites 84.3% vs 84.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.276) compared with the definitive chemoradiation group. After resection, there was an unadjusted 30- and 90-day mortality rate of 3.3% and 9.5%, respectively. A substantial survival benefit with surgical resection persisted after propensity score matching (log-rank P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In this large observational study, we found that in select patients, en bloc chest wall resection for locally advanced clinical stage T3 and N2 lung cancer was associated with improved survival compared with definitive chemoradiation. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines should be revisited.",

We conducted a nationwide population-based study to evaluate the impact of concurrent AED during post-operative chemo-radiotherapy on outcome. A total of 1057 glioblastoma patients were identified by National Health Insurance Research Database and Cancer Registry in 2008-2015. Eligible criteria included those receiving surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide, and without other cancer diagnoses. Survival between patients taking concurrent AED for 14 days or more during chemo-radiotherapy (AED group) and those who did not (non-AED group) were compared, and subgroup analyses for those with valproic acid (VPA), levetiracetam (LEV), or phenytoin were performed. Multivariate analyses were used to adjust for confounding factors. There were 642 patients in the AED group, whereas 415 in the non-AED group. The demographic data was balanced except trend of more patients in the AED group had previous drug history of AEDs (22.6% vs. 18%, P 0.078). Overall, the AED group had significantly increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.18, P 0.016) compared to the non-AED group. Besides, an adverse dose-dependent relationship on survival was also demonstrated in the AED group (HR = 1.118, P 0.0003). In subgroup analyses, the significant detrimental effect was demonstrated in VPA group (HR = 1.29,P 0.0002), but not in LEV (HR = 1.18, P 0.079) and phenytoin (HR = 0.98, P 0.862). Improved survival was not observed in patients with concurrent AEDs during chemo-radiotherapy. Our real-world data did not support prophylactic use of AEDs for glioblastoma patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Acute myeloid leukemia is a neoplasm with a high lethality, with alarming results in our country, positioning it as a priority from the point of view of oncological public health. Cytology, immunophenotype, karyogram, and a few translocations/mutations by molecular biology are currently available for diagnosis and stratification. This diagnostic approach is insufficient since it allows classifying less than 50% of patients in a specific group. Therefore, consolidation therapy is selected with little biological information. The role of morphology and cytogenetics is progressively losing prognostic weight with respect to molecular biology, and next-generation sequencing has positioned itself as a key element for diagnosing our patients. In addition, the investigation of germline mutations is acquiring greater relevance, increasing its detection frequency and influencing decision-making regarding treatment and selecting a related donor for an allogeneic transplant. In this review, an update of the integrated diagnosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia is carried out in light of the new diagnostic (WHO 2022 and ICC 2022), and prognostic classifications (ELN 2022). We propose an algorithm for integrated diagnosis to be considered for its implementation. It is imperative as a country to invest in new diagnostic technologies to improve the prognosis of our patients.",

To evaluate the proportion of samples reported as suitable for analysis obtained by cytometry (FCM) and cytology in paucicellular CSF samples. 169 samples ofpaucicellular CSF corresponding to 115 patients with hematologic neoplasms were selected. The samples were obtained by lumbar puncture in tubes conditioned with EDTA and Transfix\u00ae. We characterized the immunophenotype ofCSF samples with an 8-color panel, and 55 samples (32%) were in a small sample tube (SST). In all cases, monocytes were identified by CD14 labeling and T lymphocytes by CD3 labeling. The acquisition was carried out in a FACSCantoII\u00ae cytometer, and the analysis was performed using Infinicyt\u00ae software. The proportion of samples suitable for analysis was higher in FCM compared to cytology (98% vs 61%, p < 0.000). We identified the presence of T lymphocytes and/or monocytes in most samples (98% and 90%, respectively). In the SST samples, the number of events recorded in low-volume samples (< 1 mL) was lower than in samples with higher volume (140 vs 556, p < 0.001), with a median of identification of 3 cell populations.

Kaplan-Meier plots and univariable and multivariable Cox regression models (CRMs) predicting CSM according to marital status were used in the overall cohort and in male and female subgroups. Of 1078 liposarcoma patients, 764 (71%) were male and 314 (29%) female. Of 764 male patients, 542 (71%) were married. Conversely, of 314 female patients, 192 (61%) were married.

Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a promising treatment for gastric cancer, its toxicity may lead to the loss of skeletal muscle mass. This study investigates the changes in skeletal muscle mass during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its clinical impact on patients with locally advanced gastric cancer. Fifty patients who completed two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery were included. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using computed tomography images before and after chemotherapy. The proportion of skeletal muscle mass change (%SMC) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its cutoff value was explored using the receiver operating characteristic for the overall survival of patients undergoing R0 resection. Risk factors of skeletal muscle mass loss were also evaluated. Overall, 64% of patients had skeletal muscle mass loss during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (median %SMC -3.4%; range: -18.9% to 10.3%). Multivariable analysis identified older age (\u226570\u00a0years) as an independent predictor of skeletal muscle mass loss (mean [95% confidence interval]: -4.70% [-8.83 to -0.58], p\u00a0=\u00a00.026).

The risk of malignancy (ROM) for each category has recently been analyzed in three international databases. This paper compares the diagnostic performance of the Bethesda classification in a high-volume referral center in Belgium. All consecutive thyroid procedures were registered in a prospective database from January 2010 till August 2022. Patient and surgical characteristics, preoperative Bethesda categories, and postoperative pathology results were analyzed. Out of 2219 consecutive thyroid procedures, 1226 patients underwent preoperative FNA. Papillary thyroid cancer was the most prevalent malignancy (N\u00a0=\u00a0119, 70.4%), followed by follicular (N\u00a0=\u00a017, 10.1%) and medullary thyroid cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a015, 8.9%). Micropapillary thyroid cancer was incidentally found in 46 (3.8%) patients. Bethesda categories I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, respectively, represented 250 (20.4%; ROM 4.4%), 546 (44.5%; ROM 3.8%), 96 (7.8%; ROM 20.8%), 231 (18.8%; ROM 15.2%), 62 (5.1%; ROM 72.6%), and 41 (3.3%; ROM 90.2%) patients. Overall ROM was 13.8%. An negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.2% was found. Overall specificity was 64.2% with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 31.9%. Diagnostic accuracy was 67.8%.

Bioactive compounds include retinal and all-trans retinoic acid with important functions in vision, immune function, growth, and development. The literature search that was performed for the current scoping review yielded a total of seven publications relevant to setting the recommended daily intake for vitamin A. In total, six publications assessed the relationship of serum retinol and/or dietary vitamin A intake with fracture risk (n = 2), cancer (n = 3), and deficiency after bariatric surgery (n = 1). One additional report by the European Food Safety Administration (EFSA) with updated average requirements was included. The outcomes-based systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed positive associations for vitamin A intake and serum retinol with risk of hip fracture. Weak or inconclusive associations were observed for cancer or obesity. One publication by EFSA with updated estimated average requirements and population reference intakes for dietary vitamin A intakes was published in 2015. The EFSA recommendations and estimated average requirements are based on a European reference population, with body weights derived from an assumed body mass index of 22, which might be too low and not representative of the Nordic and Baltic populations, and consequently resulting in lower estimated average requirements and recommendations.

This disease requires multi-disciplinary treatment withneo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery or radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. This study was aimed to assess the demographic distribution, clinical behaviour and oncological outcome of Ewings Sarcoma involving upper extremity. From 2015 to 2022, 45 patients of upper extremity Ewing's sarcoma underwent treatment at a territory cancer centre. A total of 26 patients treated with surgical management were included in the study comprising 15 males (57.7\u00a0%) and 11 females (42.3\u00a0%). Mean age of presentation was 26 years (3-43 years). The most common site for Ewings sarcoma of upper extremity was Humerus(42\u00a0%) followed by Scapula(27\u00a0%), Radius(15\u00a0%), Ulna(8\u00a0%), Metacarpals(4\u00a0%) and Clavicle(4\u00a0%). Out of 26 cases, 19 (73%) underwent limb salvage surgery and 7 (27%) underwent ampuation surgery. In limb salvage group reconstruction with Extra-corporeal radiotherapy (ECRT), Ulna centralization, Megaprosthesis and 3D printed scapula was performed following wide resection of tumor. In Amputation group ray resection in one case and forequarter amputation was performed in six cases. Mean serum LDH value was 335 IU/L (2.3X Normal value) and serum albumin was 4.04\u00a0gm/dl. Mean tumour necrosis after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy was 68\u00a0%. Out of 26 cases, 19(73\u00a0%) cases underwent limb salvage and 7 patients underwent amputation surgery. Out of 26, 13 (50\u00a0%) patients developed metastasis on follow up. The Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 70 % at 12 months and 40 % at 24 months. Mean Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 33.5 months (22.3-44.6) and Median Event free survival (EFS) in current study was 25 months (19.7-30.2).

        "AbstractText": "The prevailing desmoplastic stroma and immunosuppressive microenvironment within pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) pose substantial challenges to therapeutic intervention. Despite the potential of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors in mitigating the desmoplastic stromal response and enhancing the immune milieu, their efficacy is curtailed by suboptimal pharmacokinetics (PK) and insufficient tumor penetration. To surmount these hurdles, we have pioneered a novel strategy, employing lipid bilayer-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (termed \"silicasomes\") as a carrier for the delivery of Nintedanib. Nintedanib, a triple PTK inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factor receptors, was encapsulated in the pores of silicasomes via a remote loading mechanism for weak bases. This innovative approach not only enhanced pharmacokinetics and intratumor drug concentrations but also orchestrated a transformative shift in the desmoplastic and immune landscape in a robust orthotopic KRAS-mediated pancreatic carcinoma (KPC) model. Our results demonstrate attenuation of vascular density and collagen content through encapsulated Nintedanib treatment, concomitant with significant augmentation of the CD8+/FoxP3+ T-cell ratio. This remodeling was notably correlated with tumor regression in the KPC model. Strikingly, the synergy between encapsulated Nintedanib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy further potentiated the antitumor effect. Both free and encapsulated Nintedanib induced a transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1 via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. In summary, our pioneering approach involving the silicasome carrier not only improved antitumor angiogenesis but also profoundly reshaped the desmoplastic stromal and immune landscape within PDAC. These insights hold excellent promise for the development of innovative combinatorial strategies in PDAC therapy.",

        "AbstractText": "Influenza pandemics are unpredictable recurrent events with global health, economic, and social consequences. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the latest developments in early diagnosis and specific treatment of the disease and its complications, particularly with regard to respiratory organ failure. Despite advances in treatment, the rate of mortality in the intensive care unit remains approximately 30%. Therefore, early identification of potentially severe viral pneumonia is extremely important to optimize treatment in these patients. The pathogenesis of influenza virus infection depends on viral virulence and host response. Thus, in some patients, it is associated with an excessive systemic response mediated by an authentic cytokine storm. This process leads to severe primary pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Initial prognostication in the emergency department based on comorbidities, vital signs, and biomarkers (e.g., procalcitonin, ferritin, human leukocyte antigen-DR, mid-regional proadrenomedullin, and lactate) is important. Identification of these biomarkers on admission may facilitate clinical decision-making to determine early admission to the hospital or the intensive care unit. These decisions are reached considering pathophysiological circumstances that are associated with a poor prognosis (e.g., bacterial co-infection, hyperinflammation, immune paralysis, severe endothelial damage, organ dysfunction, and septic shock). Moreover, early implementation is important to increase treatment efficacy. Based on a limited level of evidence, all current guidelines recommend using oseltamivir in this setting. The possibility of drug resistance should also be considered. Alternative options include other antiviral drugs and combination therapies with monoclonal antibodies. Importantly, it is not recommended to use corticosteroids in the initial treatment of these patients. Furthermore, the implementation of supportive measures for respiratory failure is essential. Current recommendations are limited, heterogeneous, and not regularly updated. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation is the basic treatment for patients with severe respiratory failure. Prone ventilation should be promptly performed in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, while early tracheostomy should be considered in case of planned prolonged mechanical ventilation. Clinical trials on antiviral treatment and respiratory support measures specifically for these patients, as well as specific recommendations for different at-risk populations, are necessary to improve outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "The complicated nature of tumor formation makes it difficult to identify discriminatory genes. Recently, transcriptome-based supervised classification methods using support vector machines (SVMs) have become popular in this field. However, the inclusion of less significant variables in the construction of classification models can lead to misclassification. To improve model performance, feature selection methods such as enrichment analysis can be used to extract useful variable sets. The detection of genes that can discriminate between normal and tumor samples in the association of cancer and disease remains an area of limited information. We therefore aimed to discover novel and practical sets of discriminatory biomarkers by utilizing the association of cancer and disease. In this study, we employed an SVM classification method for differentially expressed genes enriched by Disease Ontology and filtered nondiscriminatory features using Wilk's lambda criterion prior to classification. Our approach uses the discovery of disease-associated genes as a viable strategy to identify gene sets that discriminate between tumor and normal states. We analyzed the performance of our algorithm using comprehensive RNA-Seq data for adenocarcinoma of the colon, squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, and adenocarcinoma of the lung. The classification performance of the obtained gene sets was analyzed by comparison with different expression datasets and previous studies using the same datasets. It was found that our algorithm extracts stable small gene sets that provide high accuracy in predicting cancer status. In addition, the gene sets generated by our method perform well in survival analyses, indicating their potential for prognosis. By combining gene sets for both diagnosis and prognosis, our method can improve clinical applications in cancer research. Our algorithm is available as an R package with a graphical user interface in Bioconductor (https://doi.org/10.18129/B9.bioc.SVMDO) and GitHub (https://github.com/robogeno/SVMDO).",

The high plasticity of glioma cancer stem cells and the resistance they develop against multiple modalities of therapy, along with their high heterogeneity, are the main challenges faced during treatment of glioblastoma. Therefore, a better understanding of the stemness characteristics of glioblastoma cells is needed. With the development of various single-cell technologies and increasing applications of machine learning, indices based on transcriptomic and/or epigenomic data have been developed to quantitatively measure cellular states and stemness. In this study, we aimed to develop a glioma-specific stemness score model using scATAC-seq data for the first time. We first applied three powerful machine-learning algorithms, i.e. random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting, to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data to discover the most important genes associated with cellular states. We then identified promoter and enhancer regions associated with these genes. After downloading the scATAC-seq peaks and their read counts for each patient, we identified the overlapping regions between the single-cell peaks and the peaks of genes obtained through machine-learning algorithms. Then we calculated read counts that were mapped to these overlapping regions. We finally developed a model capable of estimating the stemness score for each glioma cell using overlapping regions and the importance of genes predictive of glioblastoma cellular states. We also created an R package, accessible to all researchers regardless of their coding proficiency. Our results showed that mesenchymal-like stem cells display higher stemness scores compared to neural-progenitor-, oligodendrocyte-progenitor-, and astrocyte-like cells. scATAC-seq can be used to assess heterogeneity in glioblastoma and identify cells with high stemness characteristics.

Two crucial components of sensitivity analyses are (i) the choice of a set of plausible simulation scenarios and (ii) the list of operating characteristics of interest.

We maximize a utility criterion that formalizes whether a specific set of sensitivity scenarios is adequate to summarize how the operating characteristics of the trial design vary across plausible values of the unknown parameters.

Despite various therapeutic approaches being used in clinical practice, the overall effectiveness remains insufficient. Stigmasterol, a compound known for its anti-tumor properties and ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, has been found to influenced the composition of the intestinal microbiota. However, the mechanism through which stigmasterol influences the intestinal microbial-host crosstalk in HCC remains elusive. This study was to investigate whether stigmasterol can remodel gut microbiota, and suppress tumor volume by regulating Treg and IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ cell in the host with HCC. Stigmasterol (at dosages of 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) was orally administered to Balb/c mice with subcutaneous tumor once every 2 days for 3 weeks. We first found that tumors volume in the group treated with 100 mg/kg stigmasterol were significantly decreased compared with those in the control group (P < 0.05), which exhibited a similar effect as the sorafenib treatment in mice with HCC. This resulted in a significant upregulation of Caspase3, Bax, and P53 expressions, as well as a decrease in Cyclin D1 expression, ultimately leading to a reduction in tumor volume. Additionally, stigmasterol can alter the \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity of the intestinal flora and significantly increase the abundance of Lactobacillus_johnsonii, Lactobacillus_murinus, and Lactobacillus_reuteri (P<0.05), which can lead to a decrease in the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to CD8+ T cells in the intestinal tract and tumor tissue, and consequently enhance immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in the host with HCC. In this study, we initially utilized different dosages of stigmasterol to intervene in mice with HCC and confirmed its inhibitory effects on tumor growth in vivo, and discovered that stigmasterol affected Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus murinus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, resulting in an increased proportion of IFN-\u03b3+ CD8+ T cells and Treg cells in both the intestinal mucosa and tumor tissues, and ultimately leading to increased levels of apoptotic proteins and the subsequent death of tumor cells, which shed light on the effect of stigmasterol on host intestinal tissue and intratumoral immune cells by reshaping the intestinal microbiota, and provide a theoretical foundation for the potential clinical application of stigmasterol in the treatment of HCC.",

A faecal immunochemical test (FIT) result of \u226510\u2009\u00b5g has high sensitivity and negative predictive value for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection. An FIT-based diagnostic pathway may lead to more effective resource utilisation. We aimed to use National Endoscopy Database (NED) data to create a new colonoscopy performance measure, cancer detection rate (CDR) to assess the appropriate identification of target populations for colonoscopy; then to use CDR to assess the impact of implementing an FIT-based referral pathway locally. NED data were analysed to compare local diagnostic colonoscopic CDR in 2019 (prepathway revision) and 2021 (postpathway revision), benchmarked against overall national CDR for the same time frames. 1, 123, 624 NED diagnostic colonoscopies were analysed. Locally, there was a significant increase in CDR between 2019 and 2021, from 3.01% (2.45%-3.47%) to 4.32% (3.69%-4.95%), p=0.003. The CDR increase was due to both a 10% increase in the number of CRCs detected and a 25% reduction in the number of diagnostic colonoscopies performed. Nationally, there was a smaller, but significant, increase in CDR from 2.02% (1.99%-2.07%) to 2.33% (2.29%-2.37%), p<0.001. The rate of increase in CDR% between 2019 and 2021 was significantly different locally compared with nationally. Our study indicates that the introduction of a robustly vetted FIT-based algorithm to determine whether diagnostic colonoscopy is required, is effective in increasing the colonoscopic CDR. Moreover, CDR appears to be a meaningful performance metric that can be automatically calculated through NED, enabling monitoring of the quality of referral and vetting pathways.",

We collected information on demographics, indication for referral, dates for referral, clinic visit, investigations and long-term outcomes. The average age of the patients was 71.5 years with 54% female, and a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Indications for referrals included: anaemia (11%), iron deficiency (24%), weight loss (9%), bleeding per rectum (5%) and change in bowel habits (61%).

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of thoracic segmental SA vs GA during abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures. This study was conducted at our university hospital and involved a total of 46 patients who underwent abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures. The study period spanned from January 15, 2022, to October 15, 2022. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 23) received standard GA, and group 2 (n = 23) received thoracic segmental SA. A combination of 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% and 25 \u03bcg of fentanyl was injected through the spinal needle. The epidural catheter was then threaded through the Tuohy needle after withdrawal of the spinal needle to keep only 4 cm up in the epidural space. Demographic data, both intra and postoperative hemodynamic parameters, were monitored. Postoperatively, pain in both groups was treated with intravenous (IV) morphine by patient controlled analgesia (PCA), PCA settings were 1 mg morphine/mL, no background infusion, bolus dose 2 mL and lockout interval 15 min. Postoperative, both resting VAS and VAS during cough were measured for all patients at fixed intervals, and all patients were followed up for postoperative complications. No significant variation was found in demographic data. Intra and postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) measurements were higher in group 1 than in group 2 but without a statistically significant difference (P < 0.029). Early postoperative VAS values and discharge time from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) were significantly reduced in group 2 than in group 1 (P < 0.001). The number of patients asked for analgesia and total opioid consumption were substantially reduced in group 2 than in group 1. Also, the time of the first analgesia request and patient satisfaction were substantially greater in group 2 than in group 1. Combined thoracic spinal/epidural block results in stable hemodynamics, longer postoperative analgesia with fewer side effects, and greater surgeon and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing abdominal operations and laparoscopic procedures.",

The aim of this study was to uncover the changes in the expression of m6A RNA modifiers under apoptotic conditions across various cancer cell lines. Initially, we quantified the abundance of m6A RNA modifiers in cervical (HeLa and ME180), breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), lung (A549 and H1299), and colon (Caco-2 and HCT116) cancer cell lines using qPCR. Subsequently, we induced apoptosis using cisplatin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) to activate intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, respectively, and assessed apoptosis rates via flow cytometry. Further, we examined the transcript abundance of m6A RNA modifiers under apoptotic conditions in cervical, breast, and lung cancer cell lines using qPCR. Overall, treatment with cisplatin increased the abundance of m6A modifiers, whereas TNF-\u03b1 treatment decreased their expression in cervical, breast, and lung cancer cell lines. Specifically, cisplatin-induced apoptosis, but not TNF-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis, resulted in decreased abundance of METTL14 and FTO transcripts. Additionally, cisplatin treatment drastically reduced the abundance of IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 readers.

Primary melanoma cells (M1, M21, M24, M84, M133, M307, and M2025) were obtained from patients diagnosed with melanoma. Si162 cytotoxicity tests were performed using luminescent adenosine triphosphate detection and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated. Gene expression profiles were analyzed using microarray-based gene expression data. Differentially expressed genes between the resistant and sensitive groups were identified using Pearson correlation analysis. Gene coexpression, interactions, and pathways were investigated through clustering, network, and pathway analyses. Biological functions were examined using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Molecular pathways associated with different responses to Si162 were identified using gene set enrichment analysis. The gene expressions were validated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cells revealed significant differences in response to Si162 based on the IC50 values (p < 0.05). A total of 36 differentially expressed genes associated with Si162 susceptibility were identified.

This work presents DACMVA, a novel framework to conduct data augmentation in a cross-modal dataset by translating between modalities and oversampling imputations of missing data. DACMVA was inspired by previous work on the alignment of latent spaces in Autoencoders. DACMVA is a DL data augmentation pipeline that improves the performance in a downstream prediction task. The unique DACMVA framework leverages a cross-modal loss to improve the imputation quality and employs training strategies to enable regularized latent spaces. Oversampling of augmented data is integrated into the prediction training. It is empirically demonstrated that the new DACMVA framework is effective in the often-neglected scenario of DL training on tabular data with continuous labels. Specifically, DACMVA is applied towards cancer survival prediction on tabular gene expression data where there is a portion of missing data in a given modality. DACMVA significantly (p << 0.001, one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test) outperformed the non-augmented baseline and competing augmentation methods with varying percentages of missing data (4%, 90%, 95% missing). As such, DACMVA provides significant performance improvements, even in very-low-data regimes, over existing state-of-the-art methods, including TDImpute and oversampling alone.",

Our previous studies highlighted the potent anti-cancer properties of the principal compounds found in Garcinia yunnanensis (YTE-17), attributing these effects to the regulation of multiple signaling pathways. However, knowledge regarding the mechanism and effect of YTE-17 in the prevention of colorectal cancer is limited. In this study, we conducted isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) exposed YTE-17, both in\u00a0vitro and invivo, revealing a significant inhibition of the Wnt family member 5a (Wnt5a)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Subsequently, we elucidated the influence and mechanism of YTE-17 on the tumor microenvironment (TME), specifically focusing on macrophage-mediated T helper 17 (Th17) cell induction in a colitis-associated cancer (CAC) model with Wnt5a deletion. Additionally, we performed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the colonic tissue from the Wnt5a-deleted CAC model to characterize the composition, lineage, and functional status of immune mesenchymal cells during different stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in M2 macrophage polarization and Th17 cell phenotype upon treatment with YTE-17, leading to the restoration of regulatory T (Treg)/Th17 cell balance in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model. Furthermore, we also confirmed that YTE-17 effectively inhibited the glycolysis of Th17 cells in both direct and indirect co-culture systems with M2 macrophages. Notably, our study shed light on potential mechanisms linking the non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signaling pathway and well-established canonical \u03b2-catenin oncogenic pathway in\u00a0vivo. Specifically, we proposed that Wnt5a/JNK signaling activity in IECs promotes the development of cancer stem cells with \u03b2-catenin activity within the TME, involving macrophages and T cells.

In addition, CNCM I-5321 is able to induce: (1) a pro-inflammatory immune response through stimulation of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17 cytokines and (2) apoptosis via activation of caspase 8. On the other hand, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay revealed phenotypic resistance of this strain to ampicillin and chloramphenicol. However, no known transferable determinants were found in the genome of CNCM I-5321, thus this probiotic candidate presents no risk of horizontal transfer to the intestinal bacterial population. Finally, the safety status of CNCM I-5321 was evaluated using an innovative model of chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) to assess undesirable and/or toxic effects. Overall, our results support that CNCM I-5321 strain is non-pathogenic and safe for potential use as an anti-cancer candidate in human and animal medicine.",

        "AbstractText": "Young Patients with lung cancer represent a distinct subset of patients with this neoplasm. Young International studies show increased lung cancer rates in females, while the incidence in males continues to decline. There is evidence to suggest that this trend recurs in younger patients. We studied the effects of gender differences on the incidence of surgical stages of lung cancer in young adults and its mortality rate. This study is a retrospective review (2010-2020) of young adults (aged under 45 years) with surgical-stage of lung cancer. We calculated female-to-male differences in incidence rate ratios, tumor characteristics, surgical management, and survival. Cumulative survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. We examined 46 men and 24 women, under 45 years. Female patients were diagnosed at earlier stages. The proportion of stage IA disease was significantly higher in women than in men (46% versus 13%, respectively) (p=0.03). Women were more likely never smokers (42% versus 83%, p=0.02). A histologic subtype, females were more likely to have typical carcinoid tumors (13.54% versus 10.21% for males) (p>0.05). The largest histological type in men was adenocarcinoma (25.53% versus 4.16%, p>0.05). All the patients were operated. Three men had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one was operated on for cerebral oligometastatic before his chest surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 7 women and 21 men. Despite the small number of postoperative complications in our study (n= 8, 11.2%), the male sex was significant in predicting this complication (p<0.05). The mortality rate was 1.4%. The 5-year overall survival rates were 84% in men and 87% in women. Our study identified sex differences in the incidence and mortality rates for surgical lung cancers in young adults, but the biological and endocrine mechanisms implicated in these disparities have not yet been determined.",

This study evaluated the performance of SCORE/SCORE-OP and SCORE2/SCORE2-OP in the East Asian population by using population-based cohort data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) Health Screening Cohort of Korea. A total of 324,384 NHIS examinees from 2004 to 2005 were divided into 5 age groups: 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years,70-79 years, and more than 80 years. The examinees had their predicted cardiovascular disease risks calculated by using SCORE, SCORE2, SCORE-OP, and SCORE2-OP models. The low-risk model was applied on the basis of the cohort's observed event rates. The observed and predicted cardiovascular risks were compared. A total of 324,384 subjects were included (mean age 51.4 \u00b1 7.3 years; women, 37.9% for the SCORE/SCORE2 group and mean age 73.0 \u00b1 2.8 years; women, 47.5% for the SCORE/SCORE2-OP group). Over a median follow-up of 9 years, cardiovascular events occurred in 15.0% and 28.9% in SCORE/SCORE2 and SCORE/SCORE2-OP groups, respectively. The SCORE/SCORE-OP model underestimated cardiovascular disease risk in young men (aged 40-49 years) and women (aged 40-59 years) and overestimated it in older age groups. In contrast, SCORE2/SCORE2-OP invariably overestimated the risk in all age groups and sexes. SCORE2/SCORE2-OP showed no improvement in Harrell's concordance index (C-index) compared with SCORE/SCORE-OP. Calibration plots favored SCORE2 over SCORE but not SCORE2-OP over SCORE-OP. Both SCORE2/SCORE2-OP and SCORE/SCORE-OP overestimated cardiovascular disease risk with low performance. SCORE2/SCORE2-OP showed slight improvement over older versions, but modifications are necessary for the East Asian population.",

The aims of this review were to examine the current evidence from existing literature on the risk of developing cancer and its course among people with SMI. Equivocal results emerge regarding the risk of developing some kind of cancer among people with SMI, with contrasting data on a possible higher, similar or lower risk in comparison with the general population. In contrast, a series of studies have pointed out that patients with SMI who develop cancer are less likely to receive standard levels of cancer care, both in terms of screening, diagnosis and treatment. Also, the mortality for cancer has been confirmed to be higher than the general population. A global sensitization about these problems is mandatory in an era in which community psychiatry has been developed in all countries and that policies of prevention, treatment, follow up, and palliative care should regard all the segments of the population, including people with SMI, through an interdisciplinary approach.",

        "AbstractText": "Two mangostin compounds, gamma-mangostin and alpha-mangostin, show anticancer properties through the inhibition of cell proliferation and cell migration. Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, including MDA-MB-231, highly express C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) to maintain reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell migration. This study was performed to analyze and compare different modes of action of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin as antimigratory effects targeted on CXCR4 in MDA-MB-231 as a model of TNBC cell. This study investigated the effect of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin using a series of assays, including Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay for cytotoxicity, wound healing assay for migration study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for gene expression analysis, and flow cytometry for ROS measurement, along with in silico study to observe the binding between the compound and CXCR4. The findings revealed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 25 and 20 \u03bcM for \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin in MDA-MB 231 cells, respectively. Moreover, a concentration of 10 \u03bcM was used for the migration assay. Both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin significantly suppressed cell migration within 24 hours. The present gene expression studies revealed the downregulation of key migration-associated genes, namely Farp, CXCR4, and LPHN2, upon \u03b3-mangostin treatment but not \u03b1-mangostin. Additionally, both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin increased cellular ROS generation, highlighting the same effect of \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin ROS elevation to inhibit cancer cell migration. Molecular docking simulations further suggested a potential interaction between \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin with CXCR4 in high affinity. These findings suggest that both \u03b3-mangostin and \u03b1-mangostin inhibit breast cancer cell migration and induce cellular ROS levels in MDA-MB-231 cells; notably, \u03b3-mangostin suppresses CXCR4 mRNA expression that might correlate to its activity to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell migration.",

        "AbstractText": "Cancer immunotherapy targeting adaptive immune cells has been attracting considerable interest due to its great success in treating multiple cancers. Recently, there is also increasing interest in agents that can stimulate innate immune cell activities. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting innate immune cells can block inhibitory interactions ('don't eat me' signals) between tumor cells and phagocytes. CD47 is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in various cancers and acts as a potent 'do not eat me' signal that contributes to the immune evasion of cancer cells. Anti-CD47 peptides that can bind to CD47 and block CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction were discovered using a novel phage display biopanning strategy. Anti-CD47 peptides enhanced the macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of NCI-H82 tumor cells in vitro. Unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, these peptides do not induce the agglutination of RBCs. Moreover, anti-CD47 peptides exhibit high specificity for MC-38 cancer cells expressing CD47. CMP-22 peptide showed the ability to increase the antitumor activity of doxorubicin and extends the survival of CT26 tumor-bearing mice. The discovered anti-CD47 peptides can be considered potential candidates for cancer immunotherapy by blocking the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction, especially in combination with chemotherapy, to elicit synergistic effects.",

Fluoroscopically guided radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial forceps biopsy (TB-FB) has been the conventional diagnostic method. Transbronchial cryobiopsy (TB-CB) is an alternative biopsy method. We sought to compare transbronchial cryobiopsy to transbronchial forceps biopsy for the diagnosis of SPNs. A prospective, single-centre, randomised controlled trial was conducted at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH). Patients with SPNs were randomised to either 5 transbronchial forceps biopsies or one transbronchial cryobiopsy. Complete blinding of investigators and participants was not possible, as transbronchial cryobiopsy required general anaesthesia. The primary outcome was diagnostic yield with secondary outcomes of specimen size, diagnostic yield for subsets challenging to access with forceps and safety. The overall diagnostic yield for the 28 enrolled subjects was 76.8%(22/28). The diagnostic yield was 91.7% (11/12 patients) for transbronchial cryobiopsy and 68.8% (11/16 patients) for forceps biopsy (p=0.14). Median biopsy sizes were consistently larger for the cryobiopsy arm at 7.0mm compared to 2.5mm(p<0.0001). An eccentric EBUS image signalling the probe was adjacent to the nodule occurred in 4/28 cases, and TB-CB confirmed a diagnosis in 3/3 randomised to this arm. There were no major complications with either technique. Transbronchial cryobiopsy under the guidance of fluoroscopy and radial EBUS facilitates larger biopsy specimens without a significant increase in major complications. Further research is required to confirm the effect on diagnostic yield; however, our study supports a role for TB-CB in the diagnosis of SPNs and small, nodule-adjacent biopsies.

        "ArticleTitle": "Skin Changes in Suspected Lyme Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Dear Editor, Ticks carry many diseases, bacteria, and viruses and represent a very important healthcare issue both in Croatia and globally. Although most ticks are not infected with pathogens dangerous to humans, some ticks can transmit infectious diseases with significant morbidity and mortality. This is caused by the increasing incidence of many tick-borne diseases over a growing geographical area. Many factors influence which species of ticks are present in a given geographical area, as well as the density of their population and the risk of human exposure to infected ticks. The average morbidity from Lyme borreliosis in the Republic of Croatia is 6.51 infected per 100,000 inhabitants. There can be no Lyme borreliosis without ticks infected by Borrelia burgdorferi (1,2). In Europe, Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex genotype. There are three skin manifestations of LB: erythema migrans (EM), borrelial lymphocytoma (BL), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) (3,4). Herein we describe a female patient with a diagnosis of Lyme disease based on the non-specific clinical picture and laboratory diagnostics, in whom successful treatment led to complete regression of all skin manifestations. The patient was a 58-year-old woman with no previous history of severe illness. Notably, the patient history showed that, eight months prior to presenting for the dermatological exam, the patient had observed the appearance of edema and demarcated macular exanthema around both ankles and subsequently on the dorsum of the right hand, which spread to the left hand and with gradual spread to both lower legs and the lower extremities, with more pronounced changes on the left leg. The initial dermatological examination found pronounced skin changes on both legs, especially the left leg, with erythematous changes in the form of figurate erythema forming confluences up to the size of a smaller palm; the skin of the left leg was partially mottled with normal turgor and elasticity (Figure 1a and Figure 1b). Inguinal lymph nodes were enlarged and painless on palpation. Changes were minimal and discrete on the right leg and were absent on the torso, upper extremities, and skin. Subjectively, there was no itching, burning, or tingling sensation in the affected areas of the skin. The patient subjectively reported feeling well. Family history showed that the patient's father had died from prostate cancer and that the mother had died from melanoma. Laboratory findings were as follows: hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters were normal. Venous and arterial ultrasound of both legs was normal, with the presence of reactively enlarged left inguinal lymph nodes. Lyme disease was suspected based on the clinical picture, with a differential diagnosis of possible livedo reticularis. A biopsy of the skin changes was also performed, with the results showing that the histological picture in the examined material could be compatible with the provisional clinical diagnosis of livedo reticularis. IgM and IgG specific for Borrelia burgdorferi was also performed: IgG was borderline, whereas IgM was positive at 218 U/mL. Over the next 3 weeks, Amoxil 500 mg thrice daily was introduced to the treatment. After completion of the treatment, there was a gradual regression of all skin changes without the appearance of new lesions (Figure 2a and Figure 2b) (Figure 3a and Figure 3b). Patient follow-up over the next year did not find any recurrence of similar skin changes. Herein we have described the case of a patient with atypical skin changes in which the presence of antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi was demonstrated, in which regression of all skin manifestations was achieved after diagnosis and adequate antibiotic treatment. Lyme disease has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that can generally be observed in three stages: the early localized stage, the early disseminated stage, and the late stage of the disease. However, it is also possible for the different stages to overlap and even for the late stage to manifest without any signs and symptoms of the earlier stages. Early localized stage. Characterized by skin changes - erythema migrans (EM) - usually manifests within a month of the tick bite (usually 7-14 days after the bite) (Figure 4 and Figure 5). EM manifests in approximately 80% of patients, but only 25% of patients can recall the tick bite. The skin changes are usually localized in the axilla, the groin, the cubital area, or around the waist. The changes are generally not painful, but can itch or be warm to the touch. They gradually spread over days or weeks and can grow to a radius of up to 20 cm. Initially, the coloration can be uniform for several days, after which the redness disappears around a central zone (4-6). Multiple skin changes are a sign of spirochetemia and not the result of multiple tick bites. Due to timely antimicrobial treatment, multiple skin changes are much rarer today. In the initial days or weeks after infection, patients with early, localized, or disseminated Lyme disease often present with non-specific signs and symptoms resembling a viral infection: fatigue, headache, loss of appetite, joint pain, and regional lymphadenopathy. Fever can be present in approximately 20% of patients. Laboratory findings in this phase are non-specific. Erythrocyte sedimentation can be slightly increased, leukocyte counts are mostly normal, and anemia and thrombocytopenia are present only rarely (7,8). Early disseminated stage. This stage is marked by numerous EM lesions (that generally appear days or weeks after the infection) and/or neurological and/or cardiac manifestations (occurring weeks or months after infection). Some of these patients have no data on the presence of early localized Lyme disease. The most common triad of neurological manifestations are meningitis, neuropathy (usually of the facial nerve) and motor or sensory radiculopathy (Bannwarth syndrome). All these manifestations can appear individually. Cranial nerve neuropathies can often be bilateral. Late-stage Lyme disease. Characterized by intermittent or permanent arthritis in one joint or several large joints, most commonly the knees, and/or more rarely by neurological symptoms such as discrete encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late-stage Lyme disease can develop several years after primary infection, and arthritis can be the first manifestation of the disease, with the early localized and early disseminated stages not manifesting at all. In Europe, patients with late-stage Lyme disease can present with chronic skin changes (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), which is not observed in the USA. It is caused by B. afzelii and is typically localized to the extensor surfaces of the hands and feet. It is most common in women >40 years of age but can also present in younger populations. However, due to early antimicrobial treatment of the earlier stages of the disease, late-stage manifestations are rare (9). The discovery of the etiology of this disease showed that some well-known clinical entities were also a manifestation of Borrelia infection. The etiology of other dermatologic diseases was thus determined, such as lymphocytoma (or lymphadenosis cutis benigna), which was recognized as an entity as early as 1884, as well as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, described in 1888, erythema chronicum migrans (Afzelius-Lipsch\u00fctz), and the neurological disease called Bannwarth syndrome, the symptoms of which were described as early as 1922 (10,11). LB and all its dermatological manifestations occur in almost all European countries, predominantly in the central part of the continent. The annual incidence is between 9.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in France to 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in northeastern Poland, 130 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Austria, and 155 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Slovenia (12). The total prevalence of ACA in all European patients with LB is 1-10%, depending on the region. For example, BL and ACA comprise 0.3% of LB cases in Bulgaria. In Norway, ACA comprises 5% of all clinical LB cases, and in northern Italy that number is 2.5%. Establishing a diagnosis of ACA is much more difficult than diagnosing EM or benign lymphocytoma (BL) because the clinical manifestations of ACA can vary. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is probably the most common late and chronic manifestation of LB that can be observed in European patients. The skin changes in our patient were fairly non-specific, based on descriptions from the literature, but positivity for IgM antibodies was important for establishing the diagnosis, along with the very good response to antibiotics regarding regression of skin changes as well as the histological analysis that, according to the pathohistological diagnosis, indicated livedo reticularis, which is in turn also described in the literature as a possible form of ACA depending on the stage of the disease. Skin changes on the lower extremities are often incorrectly interpreted as vascular insufficiency, e.g. chronic venous insufficiency, superficial thrombophlebitis, hypostatic eczema, obliterative arterial disease, acrocyanosis, livedo reticularis, or lymphoedema, but they can also be the result of ACA, as in our case (13-15). In cases such as the one we have described, clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can very often vary and differ greatly from the typical clinical picture. This is demonstrated by our case, which also shows that LB and its idiosyncratic manifestations can lead physicians astray in a condition where failing to establish a timely diagnosis can be fatal for the patient. This case report also serves as a reminder that Lyme disease should be considered whenever atypical skin changes are encountered. Given that ACA is a disease in the late stage of Lyme disease and that the changes in our patient were noticed at the very beginning, the disease did not develop to the later stage.",

        "AbstractText": "Mycosis fugnoides (MF) is an indolent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTLC) and is the most common of all cutaneous lymphomas. An increased risk for developing a second primary malignancy in patients with CTCL has been described in several studies, with a range from 1.04 to 2.4 (1-4). Caucasian males are at higher risk for MF development. MF is often diagnosed at ages between 55 and 67 years, and second malignancy usually occurs 5 or 6 years after the diagnosis of MF was established (5). The most common second primary malignancies include non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, and melanoma. Even though a higher incidence rate of all NHL was described in patients with MF (15/1000) in comparison with the general population (0.32/1000), there are still only a few cases of B-cell NHL following MF described in the literature (6,7). We describe a rare case of a patient with MF and simultaneous large cell transformation (LCT) and a small B-cell lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In 2017, an 82-year-old man previously treated for MF presented with two fast growing tumorous lesions with ulceration on the right tight (Figure 1). A biopsy was performed, and a diagnosis of MF with LCT was established (Figure 2). During hospitalization, mild leukocytosis (12.2 x109 L-1), lymphocytosis (64%, total count of 7.81 x109 L-1), and anemia were found. Bone marrow biopsy was not performed due to low pain threshold. Bone marrow aspirate showed 70% of atypical lymphocytes and few \"smudged\" cells. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry detected 49% monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with phenotypic features typical for B-CLL (CD5+, CD23+, kappa +). Of overall bone marrow cells, the ratio of monoclonal kappa + B-cells with the B-CLL phenotype was 21%. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood showed up to 50% monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with phenotypic features typical for B-CLL (CD5+, CD23+, kappa +). Of overall peripheral blood cells, the ratio of monoclonal kappa+ B-cells with the B-CLL phenotype was 28%. Multi-sliced computed tomography was within normal ranges. A flow cytometry showed lymphocytes with phenotypic findings for CD20+ B-CLL. A diagnosis of MF with LCT (CD30+) clinical grade IIB (T3, N0, M0) and B-CLL was established. The patient was treated with fractionated superficial irradiation that resulted in applanation and regression of the tumorous lesions. No hematologic treatment was indicated other than regular follow-up. On dermatologic follow up for 2 years, the patient was stable, with no active skin lesions and no progression of MF. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up. This is a rare case of MF with LCT and B-CLL occurring simultaneously. Large cell transformation in patients with MF can occur in 20-55% of advanced MF, as in our case, and this something physicians must be aware of, so repeated biopsies are advised (8). We also should keep in mind that patients with MF are at higher risk of developing a second malignancy. Of those second malignancies, a coexistence of lymphoproliferative disorders in two lineages, T-cell and B-cell, such as CTCL and B-CLL, is very uncommon, and only a few cases have been published (6,7,10). In most of these cases, CTCL preceded B-CLL, and with the only established explanation being increased risk of second malignancy in patients with CTCL (3,5,10). Other explanatory hypotheses include neoplastic stem cells, a genetic predisposition to malignancy, the use of immunosuppressive agents for the treatment for a first neoplasm, viral agents, and modulation of the B-cell system by monoclonal T-cell proliferation (1,5,6,9,10). Regular follow-up is mandatory for all patients with CTCL as well as MF, in order to identify the disease progression but for the timely detection of second malignancies.",

        "AbstractText": "While basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in humans, its subepidermal presentation is extremely rare. The risk factors for basal cell carcinoma development are well-known, but it remains unclear in which setting the tumor restricts itself to the dermal compartment. We present the fifth known case of subepidermal basal cell carcinoma. However, this particular presentation is unique due to arising beneath a capillary malformation. The patient had previously undergone multiple laser treatments which yielded no success. Initially, the vascular malformation was removed and sent for histopathological diagnosis. After the discovery of basal cell carcinoma, wide surgical resection was performed. The patient had no recurrence up to the last follow-up at 18 months postoperatively. This case demonstrates a new presentation of a very rare condition, but also highlights the importance of histopathological examination and the need for future research on any possible association between laser therapy and carcinogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "Multifocal infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are focal cutaneous lesions affecting more than 1 anatomic site. The multifocal distribution pattern is the rarest form of IH manifestation, accounting for only 3-4% of all affected infants. This type of cutaneous IHs may be a marker for extracutaneous disease, with the liver being the most frequently affected organ. We investigated the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a small case series of infants with multifocal IHs presenting with different clinical patterns, all diagnosed and treated in a regional tertiary-care pediatric clinic. Four infants with multifocal IHs were included in the analysis. There were 3 girls and 1 boy. Three out of 4 infants were prematurely born (2 of them very preterm), while only 1 was full-term. Clinical patterns in all cases were quite different, but more than 20 cutaneous IHs were present in each of the patients. Two infants had multifocal liver hemangioma, but without complications. In 3 out of 4 patients, systemic propranolol therapy was introduced, with excellent response in two cases (both with liver involvement). With the increase in the number of cutaneous IHs, the probability of internal organ involvement, most often the liver, also increases. Evaluation for extracutaneous lesions is indicated in infants with 5 or more cutaneous IHs. Treatment of infants with multifocal IHs should be individualized and consider all relevant risk factors, including prematurity.",

        "AbstractText": "The diagnosis of subcorneal hematoma (SH) can be challenging because the clinical presentation of SH can resemble melanocytic lesions. Few studies have examined the characteristic dermoscopic features of SH, but a more detailed large-scale study is needed to overcome the diagnostic challenge of differentiating it from acral melanoma. To describe the dermoscopic features of SH. We evaluated the clinical and dermoscopic features of 50 SH lesions from 43 patients at the Pusan National University Hospitals (Busan and Yangsan). In the color analysis, 86% of cases showed the bruise color sign; 7 cases had a single color (red to purple: 2; black: 1; brown: 4). Typical dermoscopic features of SH, acral nevi, and acral melanoma-associated patterns were observed in 60%, 0%, and 72% of lesions, respectively. Hematoma-associated patterns were homogenously red-to-black with or without satellite globules (32%) and pebbles on the ridges (28%). Acral melanoma-associated patterns showed a parallel ridge pattern (PRP) (52%), irregular dots and globules (50%), polychromia (34%), asymmetry (24%), irregular blotches (10%), and ulcers (10%). No case showed blue-white veils, regression structures, atypical vascular patterns, or irregular fibrillar patterns. The bruise color sign was positive in most cases, with acral melanoma-associated patterns (88.9%).",

We evaluated the prevalence, epidemiology, and therapy of CTCLs, focusing on its most well-known subtypes, namely mycosis fungoides (MF) and S\u00e9zary syndrome (SS). We retrospectively analyzed the medical data of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of CTCL presenting to our outpatient department during a 5-year period from January 2015 to December 2019. We evaluated the files of 102 patients, of whom 67% were men and 33% women. The overall mean age was 59.1\u00b114.1 (24-86) years. Ninety-two patients (90%) were diagnosed with MF and ten patients (10%) with SS. According to ISCL/EORTC, the majority of patients initially classified as stage IA (34%) and IB (45%). Disease frequency decreased at advanced stages (II: 4%; III: 7%; IV: 10%). Forty-five patients (44.1%) received only skin-directed therapy (SDT). Twenty patients (19.6%) progressed from SDT to systemic therapy (ST). Thirty-seven patients (36.3%) received ST combined with SDT (TS) from the start of treatment. Overall, fifty different therapeutic approaches of TS were initiated due to lack of response to therapy or disease progression. Management of CTCLs aims to maintain patient quality of life while minimizing side-effects. As CTCLs are usually incurable diseases, the focus of treatment is on symptom control and prevention of disease progression. Due to the large patient group and the long observation period, our study allows for a valid evaluation of the frequency and therapy of MF and SS in a university outpatient clinic in Germany. We favor topical therapies in early stages with more invasive therapies in advanced stages.",

The aim of this report is to assess the proportion of histologically abnormal appendices in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection in a unit where standard of care is appendectomy, with consent, when left-sided resection is performed. A retrospective study on a prospectively collected database was conducted in a single tertiary-care center. Overall, 717 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection between January 2015 and June 2021 were analyzed. The primary outcome was the proportion of histologically abnormal appendix specimens at prophylactic appendectomy. The secondary outcome was complications from prophylactic appendectomy. Overall, 576/717 (80%) patients had appendectomy at colorectal cancer surgery. In total, 234/576 (41%) had a right-/extended-right hemicolectomy or subtotal colectomy which incorporates appendectomy, and 342/576 (59%) had left-sided resection (left-hemicolectomy, anterior resection or abdominoperineal excision) with prophylactic appendectomy. At definitive histology, 534/576 (92.7%) had a normal appendix. The remaining 42/576 (7.3%) showed abnormal findings, including: 14/576 (2.4%) inflammatory appendix pathology, 2/576 (0.3%) endometriosis, 8/576 (1.4%) hyperplastic polyp, and 18/576 (3.1%) appendix tumors, which encompassed six low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMNs), three carcinoids, and nine serrated polyps. In the 342 patients who had prophylactic appendectomy, 10 (2.9%) had a neoplasm (two LAMN, three carcinoids, and five serrated polyps). There were no complications attributable to appendectomy. Occult appendix pathology in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection is uncommon when prophylactic appendectomy was performed. However, approximately 3% of patients had a synchronous appendix neoplasm.",

        "AbstractText": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are sentinels of healthy organ function, yet it is unknown how ILCs adapt to distinct anatomical niches within tissues. Here, we used a unique humanized mouse model, MISTRG mice transplanted with human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), to define the gene signatures of human ILCs in the vascular versus the tissue (extravascular) compartment of the lung. Single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with intravascular cell labeling demonstrated that heterogeneous populations of human ILCs and natural killer (NK) cells occupied the vascular and tissue niches in the lung of HSPC-engrafted MISTRG mice. Moreover, we discovered that niche-specific cues shape the molecular programs of human ILCs in the distinct sub-anatomical compartments of the lung. Specifically, extravasation of ILCs into the lung tissue was associated with the upregulation of genes involved in the acquisition of tissue residency, cell positioning within the lung, sensing of tissue-derived signals, cellular stress responses, nutrient uptake, and interaction with other tissue-resident immune cells. We also defined a core tissue signature shared between human ILCs and NK cells in the extravascular space of the lung, consistent with imprinting by signals from the local microenvironment. The molecular characterization of human ILCs and NK cells in the vascular and tissue niches of the lung provides new knowledge on the mechanisms of ILC tissue adaptation and represents a resource for further studies.",

        "AbstractText": "Fermentation is thought to be born in the Fertile Crescent, and since then, almost every culture has integrated fermented foods into their dietary habits. Originally used to preserve foods, fermentation is now applied to improve their physicochemical, sensory, nutritional, and safety attributes. Fermented dairy, alcoholic beverages like wine and beer, fermented vegetables, fruits, and meats are all highly valuable due to their increased storage stability, reduced risk of food poisoning, and enhanced flavor. Over the years, scientific research has associated the consumption of fermented products with improved health status. The fermentation process helps to break down compounds into more easily digestible forms. It also helps to reduce the amount of toxins and pathogens in food. Additionally, fermented foods contain probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that help the body to digest food and absorb nutrients. In today's world, non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and allergies have increased. In this regard, scientific investigations have demonstrated that shifting to a diet that contains fermented foods can reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. Moreover, in the last decade, there has been a growing interest in fermentation technology to valorize food waste into valuable by-products. Fermentation of various food wastes has resulted in the successful production of valuable by-products, including enzymes, pigments, and biofuels.",

        "AbstractText": "\u03b2-Elemene, an active ingredient found in medicinal plants like turmeric and zedoary, is a sesquiterpene compound with antitumor activity against various cancers. However, its current mode of production through plant extraction suffers from low efficiency and limited natural resources. Recently, there has been an increased interest in establishing microbial cell factories to produce germacrene A, which can be converted to \u03b2-elemene by a one-step reaction in vitro. In this study, we constructed an engineered Pichia pastoris cell factory for producing germacrene A. We rerouted the fluxes towards germacrene A biosynthesis through the optimization of the linker sequences between germacrene A synthase (GAS) and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (ERG20), overexpression of important pathway genes (i.e., IDI1, tHMG1, and ACS), and multi-copy integration of related expression cassettes. In combination with medium optimization and bioprocess engineering, the final titer of germacrene A in a 1\u00a0L fermenter reached 1.9\u00a0g/L through fed-batch fermentation. This represents the first report on the production of germacrene A in P. pastoris and demonstrates its advantage in producing terpenoids and other value-added natural products.",
