        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with a loss of plasticity and cognitive functioning. Previous research has shown that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) boosts cortical neurotrophic factors, potentially addressing this loss. The current study aimed to expand these findings by measuring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its downstream hippocampal signaling molecules, and behavioral effects of rTMS on the 3xTg-AD mouse line. 3xTg-AD (n = 24) and B6 wild-type controls (n = 26), aged 12 months, were given 14 days of consecutive rTMS at 10 Hz for 10 min. Following treatment, mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests and biochemical analysis of BDNF and its downstream cascades were evaluated via Western blot and ELISA. Results showed that brain stimulation did improve performance on the Object Place Task and increased hippocampal TrkB, ERK, and PLC\u03b3 in 3xTg-AD mice with minimal effects on wild-type mice. There was no significant difference in the levels of AKT and Truncated TrkB (TrkB.T1) between treatment and sham. Thus, rTMS has the potential to provide an efficacious non-invasive therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through activation of neurotrophic factor signaling.",

Survey results revealed robust agreement for assessment tool preferences for PCA features, and many respondents indicated that they reserve assessment tools for use only when PCA is suspected. For some PCA features, curated tools were preferred over validated battery tools, particularly for the office visit. Consensus recommendations superseded survey preferences for two core cognitive features within the 2017 PCA diagnostic criteria. These consensus recommendations provide an evaluation framework for PCA clinical features and can facilitate timely and accurate recognition and diagnosis of PCA. Broader use of these tools should be sought, and development and validation of novel PCA clinical outcome assessments are needed to improve our understanding of atypical AD and other dementias and support the inclusion of those with PCA in treatment trials.",

AD is highly prevalent, with increased projections over the next few decades. Yet current diagnostic methods for AD occur only after the presentation of clinical symptoms. Evidence in the literature points to potential mechanisms of AD induction beginning before clinical symptoms start to present, such as the formation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) extracellular plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Biomarkers of AD, including A\u03b2 40, A\u03b2 42, and tau protein, amongst others, show promise for early AD diagnosis. Additional progress is made in the application of biosensing modalities to measure and detect significant changes in these AD biomarkers within patient samples, such as cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood, serum, or plasma. Herein, a comprehensive review of the emerging nano-biomaterial approaches to develop biosensors for AD biomarkers' detection is provided. Advances, challenges, and potential of electrochemical, optical, and colorimetric biosensors, focusing on nanoparticle-based (metallic, magnetic, quantum dots) and nanostructure-based biomaterials are discussed.

        "AbstractText": "The human neurovascular system is a complex network of blood vessels and brain cells that is essential to the proper functioning of the brain. In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of this system in developing drugs to treat neuroinflammation. This process is believed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. While much remains to be learned about the precise mechanisms by which the neurovascular system interacts with the brain and how it can be targeted for therapeutic purposes, this area of research holds great promise for the future of neurology and medicine. Currently, creating neurovascular models begins with animal models, followed by testing on humans in clinical trials. However, the high number of medication failures that pass through animal testing indicates that animal models do not always reflect the outcome of human clinical trials. To overcome the challenges of neurovascular systems and the issues with animal models, we have developed a one-of-a-kind in vitro neurovascular unit-on-a-chip to accurately replicate the in vivo human neurovascular microenvironment. This neuroinflammation-on-a-chip platform has the potential to enhance the current methods of drug development and testing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. By replicating the human neurovascular unit in vitro, a more accurate representation of human physiology can be achieved compared to animal models. The ability to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines in situ and monitor physiological changes, such as barrier function, in real-time can provide an invaluable tool for evaluating the efficacy and safety of drugs. Moreover, using nano-sized graphene oxide for in situ detection of inflammatory responses is an innovative approach that can advance the field of neuroinflammation research. Overall, our developed neuroinflammation-on-a-chip system has the potential to provide a more efficient and effective method for developing drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases and other central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",

Progression pace prediction has important clinical values, which allow from more personalized interventional strategies, better preparation of patients and their caregivers, and facilitation of patient selection in clinical trials. We proposed a novel ADPacer model which formulated the pace prediction into an ordinal learning problem with a unique capability of leveraging training samples with label ambiguity to augment the training set. This capability differentiates ADPacer from existing ordinal learning algorithms. We applied ADPacer to MCI patient cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), and demonstrated the superior performance of ADPacer compared to existing ordinal learning algorithms.

This study explores the differences in the proximity to criticality of Alzheimer's-afflicted and cognitively normal brains through the use of a spin-lattice model derived from resting-state fMRI data and investigates the type of criticality found in the human brain - whether it is of the Ising class or something more complex. The temporal correlations in both groups display a stretched exponential nature, indicating closer alignment with the criticality of the spin-glass class rather than the Ising class. Longer relaxation times observed in cognitively normal subjects suggest increased proximity to the phase boundary.

Here, we report a case of dementia associated with anti-Rho-GTPase-activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) autoantibodies, which have never been previously linked to DLB. We describe the case of a 78-year-old man who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluorodesoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and a detailed neuropsychological evaluation. The patient presented with mild dementia syndrome associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. Neuropsychological testing revealed impaired cognitive flexibility, figural memory, and verbal memory. Fluctuating cognitive abilities with deficits in attention-executive dysfunction and visuoconstruction also developed over time. A brain MRI showed reduced biparietal and cerebellar brain volume with generalized accentuation of the outer CSF spaces. The patient's CSF revealed anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, which were also detectable in serum. In the differential complementary imaging diagnosis at 2 years, an FDG-PET revealed decreased occupancy of the posterior cingulum and precuneus. Although the FDG-PET, MRI, and clinical findings were potentially consistent with Alzheimer's disease, negative amyloid biomarkers in the CSF made an AD diagnosis highly unlikely. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [(123)I] N-omega-fluoropropyl-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-{4-iodophenyl}nortropane ([(123)I]FP-CIT) showed right-sided predominance, reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the putamen, consistent with a positive indicative biomarker finding typical of DLB. Considering the clinically probable DLB associated with the two core features of Parkinsonism and fluctuating cognition with deficits in attention, supported by an abundant tracer uptake in the right putamen and lower uptake in the left putamen on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT as an indicative biomarker, we started an antidementia drug using a cholinesterase inhibitor. Our report shows that atypical DLB may be associated with anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies, although their role and significance in the pathogenesis of DLB are unknown. However, it has to be mentioned that it is also possible that antibody-specific synthesis of anti-ARHGAP26 autoantibodies is a hallmark of a rare autoimmune disease that may cause the clinical and laboratory features involving altered dopamine transporter uptake on 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT, dementia, and mild Parkinson's symptoms rather than idiopathic DLB with only two core DLB features and inconsistent cognitive and imaging findings. Further research is needed to investigate the role of these autoantibodies in different dementias, particularly in DLB and mixed DLB-AD types.",

The provision of comprehensive dementia care faces numerous obstacles, including limited public awareness, insufficient research initiatives, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of specialized training programs. To address these challenges, the Pakistani government must acknowledge and address the stringent regulations governing the neuroscience industry, with a specific emphasis on catering to the unique needs of dementia patients. By doing so, they can ensure the delivery of high-quality care, essential support, and necessary resources for individuals living with dementia in the country.",

        "ArticleTitle": "An alternative method of SNP inclusion to develop a generalized polygenic risk score analysis across Alzheimer's disease cohorts.",
        "AbstractText": "Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have great clinical potential for detecting late-onset diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), allowing the identification of those most at risk years before the symptoms present. Although many studies use various and complicated machine learning algorithms to determine the best discriminatory values for PRSs, few studies look at the commonality of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) utilized in these models. This investigation focussed on identifying SNPs that tag blocks of linkage disequilibrium across the genome, allowing for a generalized PRS model across cohorts and genotyping panels. PRS modeling was conducted on five AD development cohorts, with the best discriminatory models exploring for a commonality of linkage disequilibrium clumps. Clumps that contributed to the discrimination of cases from controls that occurred in multiple cohorts were used to create a generalized model of PRS, which was then tested in the five development cohorts and three further AD cohorts. The model developed provided a discriminability accuracy average of over 70% in multiple AD cohorts and included variants of several well-known AD risk genes. A key element of devising a polygenic risk score that can be used in the clinical setting is one that has consistency in the SNPs that are used to calculate the score; this study demonstrates that using a model based on commonality of association findings rather than meta-analyses may prove useful.",

        "AbstractText": "Rural-dwelling older adults face unique health challenges that may increase risk for Alzheimer's disease and dementia but are underrepresented in aging research. Here, we present an initial characterization of a rural community cohort compared to an urban cohort from the same region. Adults over age 50 living in a non-metropolitan area are clinically characterized using the Uniform Data Set, enriched with additional measures of verbal and non-verbal memory measures. Neighborhood disadvantage is also assessed. Clinical and cognitive differences between cohorts were explored after stratifying by cognitive impairment. Between group comparisons found that rural-dwellers demonstrated better verbal memory than urban-dwellers on primary indices of learning, recall, and recognition, with small to medium effects in overall comparisons. When stratified by impairment, rural-urban differences were notably larger among cognitively normal individuals. Within-group comparisons found that the magnitude of impairment between cognitively normal and impaired groups was greater among rural-dwellers compared to urban-dwellers. No differences in non-verbal memory or overall clinical status were found, and there were no effects of neighborhood disadvantage on any cognitive measure. Living in a rural community presents a complex set of contextual factors that for some, may increase risk for dementia. In this study, we found small to moderate memory advantages for rural-dwellers, leaving open the possibility that late-life rural living may be advantageous for some and promote resilience. Additional prospective research is critically needed to better understand the factors that influence aging outcomes in this underrepresented population.",

        "AbstractText": "Under ideal circumstances, recruitment of older adult-caregiver dyads to dementia research is challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional barriers to recruitment, necessitating swift adjustments to pre-pandemic recruitment strategies and schedules. This brief research report describes the challenges, yield, and cost of recruiting older adult-caregiver dyads to an 18-month observational research study during COVID-19. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel in-home sensor system at identifying cognitive change in older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) through background monitoring of activities of daily living (ADL). Recruitment methods included flyers distributed alongside home-delivered meals, direct mailings, publicly available brochures, community presentations, periodical advertisements, and various other strategies. Of 510 inquiries, 117 older adult-caregiver dyads were enrolled at a total cost of ~$368,000, yielding an average per dyad recruiting cost of $3,148. Distributing flyers alongside home-delivered meals produced the most dyads (n = 46, 39%) and the least non-labor costs ($24.33) per enrolled dyad. Recruitment during the pandemic exceeded the pre-COVID-19 budget, but enrollment goals were nevertheless achieved through community-based methods. Our experience illustrates the challenge of recruiting older adult-caregiver dyads to dementia research and the value of trusted community partners in recruiting this population. Our strategies and recommendations may benefit researchers who plan to recruit community-based older adults and their caregivers for future dementia research.",

We hypothesized that the highly bioavailable CurQfen-curcumin (CGM), which has been shown to possess significant blood-brain-barrier permeability and brain bioavailability, would ameliorate dementia in neurodegenerative conditions. In the present double-blinded placebo-controlled 3-arm 3-sequence comparative study, 48 subjects characterized with moderate dementia due to the onset of Alzheimer's disease were randomized into three groups (N = 16/group) and supplemented with 400 mg \u00d7 2/day of either placebo (MCC), unformulated standard curcumin complex with 95% purity (USC), or CGM as a sachet for six months.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress interacts with IAPP aggregates and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM. To examine the role of ER stress in T2DM, we cloned the hIAPP promoter and analyzed its promoter activity in human \u03b2-cells. We found that ER stress significantly enhanced hIAPP promoter activity and expression in human \u03b2-cells via triggering X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing. We identified a binding site of XBP1 in the hIAPP promoter. Disruption of this binding site by substitution or deletion mutagenesis significantly diminished the effects of ER stress on hIAPP promoter activity. Blockade of XBP splicing by MKC3946 treatment inhibited ER stress-induced hIAPP up-regulation and improved human \u03b2-cell survival and function.

Although many A\u03b2 inhibitors are developed, their low A\u03b2-binding affinity results in unsatisfactory effect. To solve this challenge, the A\u03b2 sequence-matching strategy is proposed to tail-design dissociable nanosystem (B6-PNi NPs). Herein, B6-PNi NPs aim to improve A\u03b2-binding affinity for effective dissolution of amyloid fibrils, as well as to interfere with the in vivo fate of amyloid for A\u03b2 clearance. Results show that B6-PNi NPs decompose into small nanostructures and expose A\u03b2-binding sites in response to AD microenvironment, and then capture A\u03b2 via multiple interactions, including covalent linkage formed by nucleophilic substitution reaction. Such high A\u03b2-binding affinity disassembles A\u03b2 fibrils into A\u03b2 monomers, and induces the reassembly of A\u03b2&nanostructure composite, thereby promoting microglial A\u03b2 phogocytosis/clearance via A\u03b2 receptor-mediated endocytosis. After B6-PNi NPs treatment, the A\u03b2 burden, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments are relieved in AD transgenic mice.

        "AbstractText": "During the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative changes can be identified by measuring volumetric loss in AD-prone brain regions on MRI. Cognitive assessments that are sensitive enough to measure the early brain-behavior manifestations of AD and that correlate with biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to identify and monitor individuals at risk for dementia. Weak sensitivity to early cognitive change has been a major limitation of traditional cognitive assessments. In this study, we focused on expanding our previous work by determining whether a digitized cognitive stress test, the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales for Semantic Interference and Learning, Brief Computerized Version (LASSI-BC) could differentiate between Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) and amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) groups. A second focus was to correlate LASSI-BC performance to volumetric reductions in AD-prone brain regions. Data was gathered from 111 older adults who were comprehensively evaluated and administered the LASSI-BC. Eighty-seven of these participants (51 CU; 36 aMCI) underwent MR imaging. The volumes of 12 AD-prone brain regions were related to LASSI-BC and other memory tests correcting for False Discovery Rate (FDR). Results indicated that, even after adjusting for initial learning ability, the failure to recover from proactive semantic interference (frPSI) on the LASSI-BC differentiated between CU and aMCI groups. An optimal combination of frPSI and initial learning strength on the LASSI-BC yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.876 (76.1% sensitivity, 82.7% specificity). Further, frPSI on the LASSI-BC was associated with volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, inferior temporal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate.",

The disease is characterized by many Lewy bodies appearing in the patient's cerebrum. DLB frequently presents with a variety of autonomic symptoms from the early or prodromal stages of the disease, and these are listed as supportive features in the diagnostic criteria. As several useful assessment methods for evaluating autonomic function in DLB have been reported, this review will focus on cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction and its assessments. Cardiovascular disorders, such as orthostatic hypotension and abnormal heart rate variability, have been reported in DLB patients. Decreased myocardial uptake by metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy has been added as an indicative biomarker for DLB in the 2017 revision of the diagnostic criteria. We have reported reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia, abnormal respiratory rhythm, and high frequency of sleep-disordered breathing as abnormalities of the respiratory regulatory system associated with DLB. Since autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in DLB from the early or prodromal phase of the disease and is associated with reduced activities of daily living and quality of life, the evaluation of autonomic dysfunction is also useful in the differential diagnosis of DLB from Alzheimer's disease. There are fewer studies on the respiratory regulatory system than on the cardiovascular system, thus further research is needed to explore its role in DLB.",

        "AbstractText": "The glymphatic system plays a key role in the clearance of waste from the parenchyma, and its dysfunction has been associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, questions remain regarding its complete mechanisms. Here, we report that efflux of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/interstitial fluid (ISF) solutes occurs through a triphasic process that cannot be explained by the current model, but rather hints at the possibility of other, previously undiscovered routes from paravenous spaces to the blood. Using real-time, in vivo observation of efflux, a novel drainage pathway was discovered, in which CSF molecules enter the bloodstream directly through dynamically assembled, trumpet-shaped pores (basolateral \u03d5<8\u00a0\u03bcm; apical \u03d5 < 2\u00a0\u03bcm) on the walls of brain venules. As Zn2+ could facilitate the brain clearance of macromolecular ISF solutes, Zn2+-induced reconstruction of the tight junctions (TJs) in vascular endothelial cells may participate in pore formation. Thus, an updated model for glymphatic clearance of brain metabolites and potential regulation is postulated. In addition, deficient clearance of A\u03b2 through these asymmetric venule pores was observed in AD model mice, supporting the notion that impaired brain drainage function contributes to A\u03b2 accumulation and pathogenic dilation of the perivascular space in AD.",

Within PCTs larger, more representative sampling is possible to improve the external validity of the research. Older adults from underrepresented groups can benefit from PCTs given their historically lower engagement in clinical research. The current article focuses on older Hispanic adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Older Hispanic adults represent 19% of the US population and have a higher prevalence of ADRDs than Whites. We provide data from 2 PCTs about the recruitment of older Hispanics with ADRDs and discuss unique challenges associated with conducting PCTs and propose strategies to overcome challenges. The first PCT outlined is the Patient Priorities Care for Hispanics with Dementia (PPC-HD) trial. PPC-HD is testing the feasibility of implementing a culturally adapted version of the Patient Priorities Care approach for older Hispanic adults with multiple chronic conditions and dementia. The second PCT is the Dementia Care (D-CARE) Study, which is a multisite pragmatic study comparing the effectiveness of a health care system-based approach and a community-based approach to dementia care to usual care in patients with ADRDs and their family caregivers. The lessons learned are summarized according to the various stakeholders that need to work together to effectively recruit diverse participants for PCTs: individuals, health care systems, research teams, and communities. Individual-level considerations include communication, priorities, and flexibility. Health care system-level considerations are grounded in 4 principles of Community-Based Participatory Research and include collaboration/partnership, available resources, priorities of the health care system, and sustainability. Research team-level considerations include team members, intentionality, and communication. Community-level considerations highlight the importance of partnerships, community members, and appropriate incentives. PCTs provide a unique and potentially impactful opportunity to test interventions in real-world settings that must be culturally appropriate to reach underrepresented groups. Collectively, considering variables at multiple levels to address the needs of older adults with ADRDs is crucial, and the examples and suggestions provided in this report are a foundation for future research.",

This study investigated PM with particle size <200 nm (PM0.2) exposure-induced \u03b1-syn pathology in ICR mice and primary astrocytes, then assessed the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (PP242) in vitro studies. We observed the \u03b1-syn pathology in the brains of exposed mice. Meanwhile, PM0.2-exposed mice also exhibited the activation of glial cell and the inhibition of autophagy. In vitro study, PM0.2 (3, 10 and 30 \u00b5g/mL) induced inflammatory response and the disorders of \u03b1-syn degradation in primary astrocytes, and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2)-mediated autophagy underlies \u03b1-syn pathology.

Moreover, with the transcription factor EB (TFEB) subcellular localization and the increase in LC3II, LAMP2, CTSB, and cathepsin D proteins were identified, leading to the restoration of the degradation of \u03b1-syn after the intervention of PP242. Our results identified that PM0.2 exposure could promote the \u03b1-syn pathological dysregulation in astrocytes, providing mechanistic insights into how PM0.2 increases the risk of developing PD and highlighting TFEB/LAMP2 as a promising therapeutic target for antagonizing PM0.2 toxicity.",

However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate how network structure and dynamical characteristics alter their abnormal changes in cortical rhythm. To that end, biological data of AD and normal participates are collected. By extracting the energy characteristics of different sub-bands in EEG signals, we find that the rhythm of AD patients is special particularly in theta and alpha bands. The cortical rhythm of normal state is mainly at alpha band, while that of AD state shift to the theta band. Furthermore, recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to explore the rhythm formation and transformation between two neural states from the perspective view of neurocomputation. It is found that the neural coupling strength decreases significantly under AD state when compared with normal state, which weakens the ability of information transmission in AD state. Besides, the low-dimensional properties of RNN are obtained. By analyzing the relationship between the cortical rhythm transition and the low-dimensional trajectory, it is concluded that the low-dimensional trajectory update is slower and the communication cost is higher in AD state, which explains the abnormal synchronization of AD brain network. Our work reveals the causes for the formation of abnormal brain synchronous functional network status, which may expand our understanding of the mechanism of cognitive impairment in AD and provide an EEG biomarker for early AD.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a serious threat to human health. Researchers and clinicians alike encounter a significant obstacle when trying to accurately identify and classify AD stages. Several studies have shown that multimodal neuroimaging input can assist in providing valuable insights into the structural and functional changes in the brain related to AD. Machine learning (ML) algorithms can accurately categorize AD phases by identifying patterns and linkages in multimodal neuroimaging data using powerful computational methods. This study aims to assess the contribution of ML methods to the accurate classification of the stages of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic search is carried out in IEEE Xplore, Science Direct/Elsevier, ACM DigitalLibrary, and PubMed databases with forward snowballing performed on Google Scholar. The quantitative analysis used 47 studies. The explainable analysis was performed on the classification algorithm and fusion methods used in the selected studies. The pooled sensitivity and specificity, including diagnostic efficiency, were evaluated by conducting a meta-analysis based on a bivariate model with the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve of multimodal neuroimaging data and ML methods in the classification of AD stages. Wilcoxon signed-rank test is further used to statistically compare the accuracy scores of the existing models. With a 95% confidence interval of 78.87-87.71%, the combined sensitivity for separating participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77%; for separating participants with AD from NC, it was 94.60% (90.76%, 96.89%); for separating participants with progressive MCI (pMCI) from stable MCI (sMCI), it was 80.41% (74.73%, 85.06%). With a 95% confidence interval (78.87%, 87.71%), the Pooled sensitivity for distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77%, with a 95% confidence interval (90.76%, 96.89%), the Pooled sensitivity for distinguishing AD from NC was 94.60%, likewise (MCI) from healthy control (NC) participants was 83.77% progressive MCI (pMCI) from stable MCI (sMCI) was 80.41% (74.73%, 85.06%), and early MCI (EMCI) from NC was 86.63% (82.43%, 89.95%).

        "AbstractText": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cholinergic system dysfunction, directly affecting the hippocampal neurons. Previous experiments have demonstrated that reduced complexity is one significant effect of AD on electroencephalography (EEG). Motivated by these, this study explores reduced EEG complexity of cholinergic deficiency in AD by neurocomputation. We first construct a new hippocampal CA1 circuit model with cholinergic action. M-current IM and calcium-activated potassium current IAHP are newly introduced in the model to describe cholinergic input from the medial septum. Then, by enhancing IM and IAHP to mimic cholinergic deficiency, how cholinergic deficiency influences the model complexity is investigated by sample entropy (SampEn) and approximate entropy (ApEn). Numerical results show a more severe cholinergic deficit with lower model complexity. Furthermore, we conclude that the decline of SampEn and ApEn is due to the greatly diminished excitability of model neurons. These suggest that decreased neuronal excitability due to cholinergic impairment may contribute to reduced EEG complexity in AD. Subsequently, statistical analysis between simulated AD patients and normal control (NC) groups demonstrates that SampEn and auto-mutual-information (AMI) decrease rates significantly differ. Compared to NC, AD patients have a lower SampEn and a less negative AMI decline rate. These imply a low rate of new-generation information in AD brains with cholinergic deficits. Interestingly, the statistical correlation between SampEn and AMI is analyzed, and they have a large negative Pearson correlation coefficient. Thus, AMI reduction rates may be a complementary tool for complex analysis. Our modeling and complex analysis are expected to provide a deeper understanding of the reduced EEG complexity resulting from cholinergic deficiency.",

Many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease have shown many common points at the subcellular level. Neurons are metabolically active cells and need a high amount of energy. Mitochondria are known as the energy synthesis center for cells, involved in the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather than just being an energy synthesis center, it has critical importance for many cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis. In the process of mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular functions are disrupted and cells enter the apoptotic or necrotic pathway. Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4-trihydoxystilbene), a plant-derived polyphenol found in the seed of grapes, berries, peanuts, and wine, has many biological effects such as inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of free radicals, changes in eicosanoid synthesis, inhibition of platelet aggregation, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activity, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Through the reviewed literature, the current study investigated the protective role of resveratrol in neurodegenerative diseases.

Spatial and recognition learning and memory were evaluated from days 27-34; employing the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object recognition tests (NORT), respectively. In vitro biochemical measurements were taken of the cholinergic system and oxidative stress markers. In silico docking was used to find the role of tau protein kinase and phosphatase in the pharmacological action. In OKA-induced rats, IRJ decreased the escape latency and path length in MWM and increased the exploration time for novel objects and the discrimination index in NORT. ICV-OKA rats had higher free radicals and cytokines that caused inflammation and their level of free radical scavengers was back to normal with IRJ treatment. IRJ increased the level of acetylcholine and inhibited acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, the in silico docking study revealed the strong binding affinity of 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA), a bioactive constituent of IR, to the tau protein kinases and phosphatases. IRJ may serve as a nootropic agent in the treatment of dementia, and owing to its capacity to prevent oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and increase cholinergic tone; it has the potential to be explored as a novel strategy for the treatment of dementia and AD. More studies may be needed to develop 10-HDA as a novel drug entity for AD.",

A multimodal treatment intervention is the most feasible way to alter the course of AD progression. Hence, the current study was conducted to study the combination of betanin (BET) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) on NLRP3 regulation in aluminum chloride-induced AD in Wistar rats. BET (100,200\u00a0mg/kg) and VCO (1, 5\u00a0g/kg) alone and in combination (BET 100\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0+\u00a0VCO 1\u00a0g/kg and BET 200\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0+\u00a0VCO 5\u00a0g/kg) were given orally for 42 days.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative stress markers, estimation of NLRP3 and IL-1\u03b2, and histological examinations were conducted in the hippocampus (H) and cortex (C). Treatment with BET and VCO alone or combined improved behavioral characteristics (MWM and PA p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; EPM p\u00a0=\u00a00.5184), inhibited AChE activity (C, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0101; H, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and lowered oxidative stress in the brain.

Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant difference in age at symptom onset between monolingual and bilingual speakers within any of the FTD variants, and there were no notable differences on neuropsychological measures.

In this computational modelling study, we test the hypotheses that this metric, and related measures of signal variability and functional connectivity, are sensitive to altered E-I ratios. The E-I ratio in each neural mass of a whole-brain computational network model was systematically varied. We evaluated whether JPEinv, local signal variability (by permutation entropy) and functional connectivity (by weighted symbolic mutual information (wsMI)) were related to E-I ratio, on whole-brain and regional level. The hub disruption index can identify regions primarily affected in terms of functional connectivity strength (or: degree) by the altered E-I ratios. Analyses were performed for a range of coupling strengths, filter and time-delay settings. On whole-brain level, higher E-I ratios were\u00a0associated with higher functional connectivity (by JPEinv and wsMI) and lower local signal variability. These relationships were nonlinear and\u00a0depended on the\u00a0coupling strength, filter and time-delay settings. On regional level, hub-like regions showed a selective decrease in functional degree (by JPEinv and wsMI) upon a lower E-I ratio, and non-hub-like regions showed a selective increase in degree upon a higher E-I ratio. These results suggest that abnormal functional connectivity and signal variability, as previously reported in patients across the AD continuum, can inform us about altered E-I ratios.

        "ArticleTitle": "Spectral analysis and Bi-LSTM deep network-based approach in detection of mild cognitive impairment from electroencephalography signals.",
        "AbstractText": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neuropsychological syndrome that is characterized by cognitive impairments. It typically affects adults 60\u00a0years of age and older. It is a noticeable decline in the cognitive function of the patient, and if left untreated it gets converted to Alzheimer's disease (AD). For that reason, early diagnosis of MCI is important as it slows down the conversion of the disease to AD. Early and accurate diagnosis of MCI requires recognition of the clinical characteristics of the disease, extensive testing, and long-term observations. These observations and tests can be subjective, expensive, incomplete, or inaccurate. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful choice for the diagnosis of diseases with its advantages such as being non-invasive, based on findings, less costly, and getting results in a short time. In this study, a new EEG-based model is developed which can effectively detect MCI patients with higher accuracy. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of EEG signals recorded from a total of 34 subjects, 18 of whom were MCI and 16 control groups was used, and their ages ranged from 40 to 77. To conduct the experiment, the EEG signals were denoised using Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), and to increase the size of the dataset Data Augmentation (DA) method was performed. The tenfold cross-validation method was used to validate the model, moreover, the power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals was extracted from the EEG signals using three spectral analysis methods, the periodogram, welch, and multitaper. The PSD graphs of the EEG signals showed signal differences between the subjects of control and the MCI group, indicating that the signal power of MCI patients is lower compared to control groups. To classify the subjects, one of the best classifiers of deep learning algorithms called the Bi-directional long-short-term-memory (Bi-LSTM) was used, and several machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). These algorithms were trained and tested using the extracted feature vectors from the control and the MCI groups. Additionally, the values of the coefficient matrix of those algorithms were compared and evaluated with the performance evaluation matrix to determine which one performed the best overall. According to the experimental results, the proposed deep learning model of multitaper spectral analysis approach with Bi-LSTM deep learning algorithm attained the highest number of correctly classified samples for diagnosing MCI patients and achieved a remarkable accuracy compared to the other proposed models. The achieved classification results of the deep learning model are reported to be 98.97% accuracy, 98.34% sensitivity, 99.67% specificity, 99.70% precision, 99.02% f1 score, and 97.94% Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).",

To date, CNN classifiers were widely applied to assist the early diagnosis of AD and its associated abnormal structures. However, most existing black-box CNN classifiers relied heavily on the limited MRI scans, and used little domain knowledge from the previous clinical findings. In this study, we proposed a framework, named as PINet, to consider the previous domain knowledge as a Privileged Information (PI), and open the black-box in the prediction process. The input domain knowledge guides the neural network to learn representative features and introduced intepretability for further analysis. PINet used a Transformer-like fusion module Privileged Information Fusion (PIF) to iteratively calculate the correlation of the features between image features and PI features, and project the features into a latent space for classification. The Pyramid Feature Visualization (PFV) module served as a verification to highlight the significant features on the input images. PINet was suitable for neuro-imaging tasks and we demonstrated its application in Alzheimer's Disease using structural MRI scans from ADNI dataset. During the experiments, we employed the abnormal brain structures such as the Hippocampus as the PI, trained the model with the data from 1.5T scanners and tested from 3T scanners. The F1-score showed that PINet was more robust in transferring to a new dataset, with approximatedly 2% drop (from 0.9471 to 0.9231), while the baseline CNN methods had a 29% drop (from 0.8679 to 0.6154). The performance of PINet was relied on the selection of the domain knowledge as the PI. Our best model was trained under the guidance of 12 selected ROIs, major in the structures of Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe. In summary, PINet considered the domain knowledge as the PI to train the CNN model, and the selected PI introduced both interpretability and generalization ability to the black box CNN classifiers.",

        "AbstractText": "The Northwestern Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (NAVS) assesses verb and sentence production and comprehension in aphasia. Results from the original English version and from its adaptation to German have shown that the NAVS is able to capture effects of verb-argument structure (VAS) complexity (i.e., lower accuracy for two- and three-argument vs. one-argument verbs) and syntactic complexity (i.e., lower accuracy for non-canonical vs. canonical sentences) in both agrammatic participants and individuals with mild (residual) forms of aphasia. The NAVS has been recently adapted to Italian (NAVS-I) and tested on a group of healthy participants, with results showing longer reaction times to complex vs. simple verbs and sentences. The present study aimed to test the ability of NAVS-I to i) capture verb/sentence production and comprehension deficits in Italian-speaking individuals with agrammatism or with fluent aphasia, and ii) differentiate individuals with aphasia from healthy age-matched participants, with the overall goal to validate its use in clinical practice. Forty-four healthy participants and 28 individuals with aphasia (10 with agrammatic speech production) were administered the NAVS-I, which includes tasks assessing production and comprehension of verbs requiring one, two or three arguments, as well as production and comprehension of canonical and non-canonical sentences. On the Verb Naming Task (VNT), better production of one- (vs. two- and three-) argument verbs was found in the agrammatic group, whereas, verb production in the fluent group was solely predicted by word length and imageability. No effects of argument optionality (i.e., greater difficulty for optionally transitive verbs than for 1-argument verbs) were found. Sentence-level tasks found no differences between the agrammatic and the fluent group in production or comprehension of both canonical and non-canonical sentences; rather, sentence comprehension accuracy was predicted by demographic variables and by aphasia severity. At the individual level, performance on the NAVS-I was significantly different from that of healthy speakers in 26/28 patients. Data show that the NAVS-I is able to capture effects of argument structure complexity in verb production, and effects of syntactic complexity in sentence production and comprehension. In addition, our results point to verb production as the task with greater capability to differentiate agrammatism from other (fluent) forms of aphasia. The study provides support for the use of the NAVS-I in the diagnosis of aphasia, as it is able to detect language deficits at the individual level, even in participants with mild (residual) forms of aphasia.",

        "AbstractText": "The Event Based Model (EBM) is a probabilistic generative model to explore biomarker changes occurring as a disease progresses. Disease progression is hypothesized to occur through a sequence of biomarker dysregulation \"events\". The EBM estimates the biomarker dysregulation event sequence. It computes the data likelihood for a given dysregulation sequence, and subsequently evaluates the posterior distribution on the dysregulation sequence. Since the posterior distribution is intractable, Markov Chain Monte-Carlo is employed to generate samples under the posterior distribution. However, the set of possible sequences increases as N! where N is the number of biomarkers (data dimension) and quickly becomes prohibitively large for effective sampling via MCMC. This work proposes the \"scaled EBM\" (sEBM) to enable event based modeling on large biomarker sets (e.g. high-dimensional data). First, sEBM implicitly selects a subset of biomarkers useful for modeling disease progression and infers the event sequence only for that subset. Second, sEBM clusters biomarkers with similar positions in the event sequence and only orders the \"clusters\", with each successive cluster corresponding to the next stage in disease progression. These two modifications used to construct the sEBM method provably reduces the possible space of event sequences by multiple orders of magnitude. The novel modifications are supported by theory and experiments on synthetic and real clinical data provides validation for sEBM to work in higher dimensional settings. Results on synthetic data with known ground truth shows that sEBM outperforms previous EBM variants as data dimensions increase. sEBM was successfully implemented with up to 300 biomarkers, which is a 6-fold increase over previous EBM applications. A real-world clinical application of sEBM is performed using 119 neuroimaging markers from publicly available Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to stratify subjects into 6 stages of disease progression. Subjects included cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). sEBM stage is differentiated for the 3 groups (\u03c72p-value<4.6e-32). Increased sEBM stage is a strong predictor of conversion risk to AD (p-value<2.3e-14) for MCI subjects, as verified with a Cox proportional-hazards model adjusted for age, sex, education and APOE4 status.

Delirium is associated with a significant increase in mortality and the US health care costs associated with delirium are estimated at over $164 billion annually. Despite the prevalence of the condition, the molecular pathophysiology of delirium remains unexplained, limiting the development of pharmacotherapies. Delirious patients can be identified by prominent impairments in attention and working memory (WM), two cognitive domains that localize to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The dlPFC is also a key site for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and given the high risk of delirium in AD patients, suggests that efforts at understanding delirium might focus on the dlPFC as a final common endpoint for cognitive changes. Preclinical studies of the dlPFC reproduce many of the pharmacological observations made of delirious patients, including sensitivity to anticholinergics and an 'inverted U' pattern of dependence on monoaminergic input, with diminished performance outside a narrow range of signaling. Medications like guanfacine, which influence the dlPFC in the context of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), have emerged as therapies for delirium and motivate a detailed understanding of the influence of \u03b1-2 agonists on WM.

Two studies (1 in vitro and 1 in vivo) evaluated ALS disease and 1 in vivo study evaluated HD. Moderate evidence was found for in vitro studies reporting the positive effect of OCDSCs on PD or AD recovery. Strong evidence was found for in vivo studies in which PD animal models were used; meanwhile, moderate evidence was found for the impact of OCDSCs on AD recovery. Limited evidence was found for in vivo studies evaluating HD and ALS. Although studies reported favorable data regarding the OCDSCs on NDs, they presented a considerable risk of bias.

However, the specific associations between these pathological changes remain unclear. In this study, we utilized A\u03b242-induced AD rats and primary neural cells as in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro models. The investigations included behavioural tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis, Nissl staining, thioflavin-S staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunofluorescence staining, proteomics, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detection, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assessment, mitochondrial morphology analysis, electrophysiological studies, Western blotting, and molecular docking. The results revealed changes in synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in the AD models. Remarkably, intervention with Dengzhan Shengmai (DZSM) capsules emerged as a pivotal element in this investigation. A\u03b242-induced synaptic dysfunction was significantly mitigated by DZSM intervention, which notably amplified the frequency and amplitude of synaptic transmission. The cognitive impairment observed in AD rats was ameliorated and accompanied by robust protection against structural damage in key brain regions, including the hippocampal CA3, primary cingular cortex, prelimbic system, and dysgranular insular cortex. DZSM intervention led to increased IDE levels, augmented long-term potential (LTP) amplitude, and enhanced dendritic spine density and length. Moreover, DZSM intervention led to favourable changes in mitochondrial parameters, including ROS expression, MMP and ATP contents, and mitochondrial morphology. In conclusion, our findings delved into the realm of altered synaptic currents, mitophagy, and mitochondrial dynamics in AD, concurrently highlighting the therapeutic potential of DZSM intervention.",

Several studies have identified mechanistic links between the increased presence of EVs and the process of senescence. A recent study reveals that the reverse transcribed complementary DNA (cDNA) of a human endogenous retroviral sequence can activate the innate immune system and result in tissue damage and/or the spread of cellular senescence to distant tissues. Several studies have linked EVs to age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and have included isolation of EVs from individuals with these diseases. Loss of epigenetic regulation, immune activation, and environmental stimuli can all lead to the expression of endogenous retroviruses and the incorporation of their proteins and transcripts into EVs. In addition, EVs disseminating these endogenous retroviral components have now been shown to act in a paracrine manner in multiple human diseases. Further investigation of the connection between EVs containing endogenous retroviral protein products or nucleotides should be pursued in models of age-related diseases.",

        "AbstractText": "Most chemicals expressed in mammalian cells have complex delivery and transport mechanisms to get to the right intracellular sites. One of these mechanisms transports most transmembrane proteins, as well as almost all secreted proteins, from the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are formed, to their final location. Nearly all eukaryotic cells have a membrane trafficking mechanism that is both a prominent and critical component. This system, which consists of dynamically coupled compartments, supports the export and uptake of extracellular material, remodeling and signaling at the cellular interface, intracellular alignment, and maintenance of internal compartmentalization (organelles). In animal cells, this system enables both regular cellular activities and specialized tasks, such as neuronal transmission and hormone control. Human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, and cancer, are associated with the dysfunction or dysregulation of the membrane trafficking system. Treatment and cure of human diseases depends on understanding the cellular and molecular principles underlying membrane trafficking pathways. A single gene mutation or mutations that result in impaired membrane trafficking cause a range of clinical disorders that are the result of changes in cellular homeostasis. Other eukaryotic organisms with significant economic and agricultural value, such as plants and fungi, also depend on the membrane trafficking system for their survival.

AD is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Recent research on AD has made significant strides, including the development of an \"amyloid clock\" biomarker that tracks AD progression through positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Surf4 and other genes have been discovered to play a role in regulating beta-amyloid toxicity, while inhibiting the enzyme hexokinase-2 has shown positive results in preclinical studies. New brain mapping techniques have identified early brain-based causes of cognitive changes in AD, and biomarkers such as neuronal pentraxin protein Nptx2 and astrocytic 7-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChRs) show potential for early detection. Other approaches, such as replenishing the enzyme Tip60, selectively degrading the modified protein p-p38 with PRZ-18002, and targeting the protein voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), have shown promise in enhancing cognitive function and preventing pathophysiological alterations linked to AD. Baseline blood samples and other biomarkers such as urine formic acid, p-tau 198, microRNAs, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) have also been discovered for early detection and intervention of AD. Additionally, recent FDA approvals for medications such as aducanumab and lecanemab provide options for reducing AD symptoms and improving function, while clinical trials for dementia vaccines show promise for the nasal and beta-amyloid 40 vaccines as well as vaccinations targeting tau. These advancements in AD research, including biomarker discovery and the development of disease-modifying treatments, are crucial steps towards improving the lives of those affected by AD and finding a cure for this debilitating disease.",

There is considerable ongoing debate concerning the relative advantages and disadvantages of surgical treatment (internal fixation or arthroplasty) vs nonoperative treatment for femoral neck fractures in older persons with AD. This retrospective cohort study compared the mortality, hazard ratio, and survival rate between operative and nonoperative treatments, controlling for patients' demographic information and baseline health status. The study population consisted of Optum beneficiaries diagnosed with AD who experienced an initial femoral neck fracture claim between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2017. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were applied to compare the treatment groups' post-fracture survival rates and mortality. Cox regression was used to examine the survival period by controlling the covariates. Out of the 4157 patients with AD with femoral neck fractures, 59.8% were women (n\u2009=\u20092487).

Early symptoms include the loss of memory and mild cognitive ability; however, as the disease progresses, these symptoms can present with increased severity manifesting as mood and behaviour changes, disorientation, and a loss of motor/body control. AD is one of the leading causes of death in the UK, and with an ever-increasing ageing society, patient numbers are predicted to rise posing a significant global health emergency. AD is a complex neurophysiological disorder where pathology is characterized by the deposition and aggregation of misfolded amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)-protein that in-turn promotes excessive tau-protein production which together drives neuronal cell dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. It is widely accepted that AD is driven by a combination of both genetic and immunological processes with recent data suggesting that adaptive immune cell activity within the parenchyma occurs throughout disease. The mechanisms behind these observations remain unclear but suggest that manipulating the adaptive immune response during AD may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Using immunotherapy for AD treatment is not a new concept as the only two approved treatments for AD use antibody-based approaches to target A\u03b2. However, these have been shown to only temporarily ease symptoms or slow progression highlighting the urgent need for newer treatments. This review discusses the role of the adaptive immune system during AD, how microbial infections may be contributing to inflammatory immune activity and suggests how adaptive immune processes can pose as therapeutic targets for this devastating disease.",

The brain functional network is suitable to bridge the correlation between abnormal connectivities and dementia disorders. However, it is challenging to access considerable amounts of brain functional network data, which hinders the widespread application of data-driven models in dementia diagnosis. In this study, a novel distribution-regularized adversarial graph auto-Encoder (DAGAE) with transformer is proposed to generate new fake brain functional networks to augment the brain functional network dataset, improving the dementia diagnosis accuracy of data-driven models. Specifically, the label distribution is estimated to regularize the latent space learned by the graph encoder, which can make the learning process stable and the learned representation robust. Also, the transformer generator is devised to map the node representations into node-to-node connections by exploring the long-term dependence of highly-correlated distant brain regions. The typical topological properties and discriminative features can be preserved entirely. Furthermore, the generated brain functional networks improve the prediction performance using different classifiers, which can be applied to analyze other cognitive diseases. Attempts on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed model can generate good brain functional networks. The classification results show adding generated data can achieve the best accuracy value of 85.33%, sensitivity value of 84.00%, specificity value of 86.67%. The proposed model also achieves superior performance compared with other related augmented models.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a terrible and degenerative disease commonly occurring in the elderly. Early detection can prevent patients from further damage, which is crucial in treating AD. Over the past few decades, it has been demonstrated that neuroimaging can be a critical diagnostic tool for AD, and the feature fusion of different neuroimaging modalities can enhance diagnostic performance. Most previous studies in multimodal feature fusion have only concatenated the high-level features extracted by neural networks from various neuroimaging images simply. However, a major problem of these studies is over-looking the low-level feature interactions between modalities in the feature extraction stage, resulting in suboptimal performance in AD diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a dual-branch vision transformer with cross-attention and graph pooling, namely CsAGP, which enables multi-level feature interactions between the inputs to learn a shared feature representation. Specifically, we first construct a brand-new cross-attention fusion module (CAFM), which processes MRI and PET images by two independent branches of differing computational complexity.

Recent studies have shown how hypertension is related to cognitive decline in elderly patients, which in turn leads to increased mortality as well as morbidity. There have been various studies that have looked at the effect of antihypertensive drugs in reducing cognitive decline, and their results have proved inconclusive. However, most of these studies assume the treatment effect is similar for all patients, thus considering only the average treatment effects of antihypertensive drugs. In this paper, we assume that the effect of antihypertensives on the onset of AD depends on patient characteristics. We develop a deep learning method called LASSO-Dragonnet to estimate the individualized treatment effects of each patient. We considered six antihypertensive drugs, and each of the six models considered one of the drugs as the treatment and the remaining as control. Our studies showed that although many antihypertensives have a positive impact in delaying AD onset on average, the impact varies from individual to individual, depending on their various characteristics. We also analyzed the importance of various covariates in such an estimation. Our results showed that the individualized treatment effects of each patient could be estimated accurately using a deep learning method, and that the importance of various covariates could be determined.",

        "AbstractText": "Cortical thickness is an important biomarker associated with gray matter atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases. In order to conduct meaningful comparisons of cortical thickness between different subjects, it is imperative to establish correspondence among surface meshes. Conventional methods achieve this by projecting surface onto canonical domains such as the unit sphere or averaging feature values in anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). However, due to the natural variability in cortical topography, perfect anatomically meaningful one-to-one mapping can be hardly achieved and the practice of averaging leads to the loss of detailed information. For example, two subjects may have different number of gyral structures in the same region, and thus mapping can result in gyral/sulcal mismatch which introduces noise and averaging in detailed local information loss. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new method that can overcome these intrinsic problems to construct more meaningful comparison for atrophy detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel personalized patch-based method to improve cortical thickness comparison across subjects. Our model segments the brain surface into patches based on gyral and sulcal structures to reduce mismatches in mapping method while still preserving detailed topological information which is potentially discarded in averaging. Moreover,the personalized templates for each patch account for the variability of folding patterns, as not all subjects are comparable. Finally, through normality assessment experiments, we demonstrate that our model performs better than standard spherical registration in detecting atrophy in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

However, the effects of magnesium-L-threonate on the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease remain unknown. Previously, we reported that magnesium-L-threonate treatment improved cognition and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation in a double-transgenic line of Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing the amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein and mutant human presenilin 1 (APP/PS1). Here, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze changes in the microbiome and serum metabolome following magnesium-L-threonate exposure in a similar mouse model. Magnesium-L-threonate modulated the abundance of three genera in the gut microbiota, decreasing Allobaculum and increasing Bifidobacterium and Turicibacter. We also found that differential metabolites in the magnesium-L-threonate-regulated serum were enriched in various pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The western blotting detection on intestinal tight junction proteins (zona occludens 1, occludin, and claudin-5) showed that magnesium-L-threonate repaired the intestinal barrier dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice.

Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC) scales are composite scores calculated as the sum of the component test scores weighted by the reciprocal of their standard deviations at the baseline visit. Reciprocal standard deviation is an arbitrary weighting in this context, and may be an inefficient utilization of the data contained in the component measures. Mathematically derived optimal composite weighting is a promising alternative. Sample size projections using standard power calculation formulas were used to describe the relative performance of component measures and their composites when used as endpoints for clinical trials. Power calculations were informed by (n=1,333) amnestic mild cognitive impaired participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set. A composite constructed using PACC reciprocal standard deviation weighting was both less sensitive to change than one of its component measures and less sensitive to change than its optimally weighted counterpart. In standard sample size calculations informed by NACC data, a clinical trial using the PACC weighting would require 38% more subjects than a composite calculated using optimal weighting. These findings illustrate how reciprocal standard deviation weighting can result in inefficient cognitive composites, and underscore the importance of component weights to the performance of composite scales. In the future, optimal weighting parameters informed by accumulating clinical trial data may improve the efficiency of clinical trials in AD.",

With limited therapeutic options, clinical trials have been investigating Alzheimer's disease treatment using more novel approaches, including gene therapy. However, there is limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of such treatments. Objectives: This research aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical gene therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease at varying degrees of severity. Methods: A Markov model with a 20-year time horizon was constructed for simulated cohorts with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, assigned to receive either standard of care or a one-time gene therapy administration. Varying costs of care due to disease severity and treatment efficacy were utilized to determine the effect of those variables at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. Results: Under the initial assumption that the hypothetical gene therapy grants a 30% risk reduction in disease progression and entry into institutional care, the maximum cost-effective price for gene therapy is $141,126 per treatment using the threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). By increasing the treatment effectiveness to 50%, cost-effective price nearly doubled at each willingness-to-pay threshold (e.g.,\u00a0$260,902 at the $150,000/QALY threshold). Conclusion: Despite being cost-effective at a very high price, the hypothetical gene therapy for AD would still need to be priced considerably lower than other approved gene therapies on the market. Thus, a comprehensive pharmacoeconomic assessment remains critical in pricing innovative therapy and determining coverage for patients in need.",

Moreover, it employs Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter learning of both the model and loss function.

The oral mucosal wound-healing process was investigated using propolis water extract (PWE) incubation with gingival fibroblast cells and concluded that propolis was effective on the oral mucosal wound-healing pattern compared to untreated controls. Additionally, phenolic compounds (fraxetin, apigenin, galangin, pinobanksin, chrysin, etc.) were isolated from propolis, and their chemical structures were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer potential activities of PWE and some isolated compounds were screened and revealing their inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with IC50 values ranging from 0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 to 1.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03\u2009mM, as well as remarkable free-radical scavenging and metal reduction capacities. The results suggest that these compounds and PWE can be used as therapeutic agents due to their antioxidant properties and inhibitory potential on AChE. It can also be used for therapeutic purposes since its wound-healing effect is promising.",

The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the \u03b2- (BACE) and \u03b3- (PS1, PS2) secretases is a critical step in the amyloidogenic pathway. The induction of neuronal apoptosis by A\u03b2 involves increased expression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X (Bax) and decreased Bcl-2 expression. The seed of Carthamus tinctorius L. (CTS) and the aerial part of Taraxacum coreanum (TC) are traditional herbs used to treat several neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the neuroprotective effects of co-treatment with CTS and TC on A\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. CTS, TC, and the co-treatment (CTS\u2009+\u2009TC) were added to A\u03b225-35-treated SH-SY5Y cells. CTS\u2009+\u2009TC synergistically increased cell viability and inhibited reactive oxygen species production. CTS\u2009+\u2009TC resulted in significant downregulation of BACE, PS1, PS2, and APP, as well as the 99-aa C-terminal domain of APP, compared with either CTS or TC alone. Compared with the single herbs, co-treatment with CTS and TC markedly decreased the expression of Bax and increased the expression of Bcl-2, consistent with its anti-apoptotic effects. These findings suggest that co-treatment with CTS and TC may be useful for AD prevention.",

        "AbstractText": "Disturbances in the local and peripheral immune systems are closely linked to a wide range of diseases. In the context of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), inflammation plays a crucial role, often appearing as a common manifestation despite the variability in the occurrence of other pathophysiological hallmarks. Thus, combating neuroinflammation holds promise in treating complex pathophysiological diseases like AD. Growing evidence suggests the gut microbiome's crucial role in shaping the pathogenesis of AD by influencing inflammatory mediators. Gut dysbiosis can potentially activate neuroinflammatory pathways through bidirectional signaling of the gut-brain axis; however, the precise mechanisms of this complex interweaved network remain largely unclear. In these milieus, this review attempts to summarize the contributing role of gut microbiome-mediated neuroinflammatory signals in AD pathophysiology, while also pondering potential mechanisms through which commensal and pathogenic gut microbes affect neuroinflammation. While certain taxa such as Roseburia and Escherichia have been strongly correlated with AD, other clades such as Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium exhibit variations at the species and strain levels. In order to disentangle the inflammatory aspects of neurodegeneration attributed to the gut microbiome, it is imperative that future mechanistic studies investigate the species/strain-level dependency of commensals, opportunistic, and pathogenic gut microbes that consistently show correlations with AD patients across multiple associative studies.",

Many existing studies have explored the potential of these two distinct modalities with diverse machine and deep learning approaches. But successfully fusing MRI and PET can be complex due to their unique characteristics and missing modalities. To this end, we develop a hybrid multimodality fusion (HMF) framework with cross-domain knowledge transfer for joint MRI and PET representation learning, feature fusion, and cognitive decline progression forecasting. Our HMF consists of three modules: 1) a module to impute missing PET images, 2) a module to extract multimodality features from MRI and PET images, and 3) a module to fuse the extracted multimodality features. To address the issue of small sample sizes, we employ a cross-domain knowledge transfer strategy from the ADNI dataset, which includes 795 subjects, to independent small-scale AD-related cohorts, in order to leverage the rich knowledge present within the ADNI. The proposed HMF is extensively evaluated in three AD-related studies with 272 subjects across multiple disease stages, such as subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches in forecasting progression trajectories of AD-related cognitive decline.",

We bridge this gap by introducing a method based on comparing output of a pre-trained neural language model (NLM) with an artificially degraded version of itself to examine the transcripts of speech produced by seniors with and without dementia and healthy children during spontaneous language tasks. We compare a range of linguistic characteristics including language model perplexity, syntactic complexity, lexical frequency and part-of-speech use across these groups. Our results indicate that healthy seniors and children older than 8 years share similar linguistic characteristics, as do dementia patients and children who are younger than 8 years. Our study aligns with the growing evidence that language deterioration in dementia mirrors language acquisition in development using computational linguistic methods based on NLMs. This insight underscores the importance of further research to refine its application in guiding developmentally appropriate patient care, particularly in early stages.",

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) on improving dementia symptoms in patients with DEACMP. A retrospective analysis was performed on DEACMP patients, who visited Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from June 2014 to June 2020. Among them, patients who received conventional drug treatment combined with HBO2 treatment were included in an HBO2 group, while those who only received conventional drug treatment were included in a control group. HBO2 was administered once daily. Patients in the HBO2 group received 6 courses of treatment, with each course consisting of 10 sessions. The Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS) was used to diagnose dementia, and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was used to grade the severity of dementia for DEACMP. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Section (ADAS-Cog), the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus) were performed to assess cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), behavioral and psychological symptoms, and overall function. The study further analyzed the results of objective examinations related to patients' dementia symptoms, including magnetic resonance imaging detection of white matter lesions and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). The changes of the above indicators before and after treatment, as well as the differences between the 2 groups after treatment were compared. There was no significant difference in the HDS score and CDR grading between the 2 groups before treatment (both P>0.05). After treatment, the score of ADAS-Cog, FAQ, NPI, and CIBIC Plus grading of the 2 groups were significantly improved, and the improvement of the above indicators in the HBO2 group was greater than that in the control group (all P<0.05). The effective rate of the HBO2 group in treating DEACMP was significantly higher than that of the control group (89.47% vs 65.87%, P<0.05). The objective examination results (white matter lesions and abnormal EEG) showed that the recovery of patients in the HBO2 group was better than that in the control group.

Given the need for early detection of neurodegenerative disorders, the current study investigated the associations between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in brain regions associated with neurodegenerative disorders and memory function with plasma NFL in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: We recruited 29 AD, 76 MCI, and 39 HCs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database in the current cross-sectional study. We used Pearson's correlation models adjusted for the effect of age, sex, and APOE genotype to investigate the association between plasma NFL and rCBF. Results: We found non-significant differences in age (F(2, 141) = 1.304; P = 0.275) and years of education (F(2, 141) = 0.013; P = 0.987). Additionally, we found significant differences between groups in terms of MMSE scores (F(2, 141) = 100.953; P < 0.001). Despite the observation of significantly reduced rCBF in AD and MCI groups versus HCs, we did not detect significant differences in plasma NFL between these groups. We found significant negative associations between plasma NFL and rCBF in various AD-related regions, these findings were only observed after analyses in all participants, and were observed in HCs alone and no significant associations were observed in the AD or MCI groups. Conclusion: These outcomes add to our current understanding surrounding the use of rCBF and plasma NFL biomarkers as tools for early detection and diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. A conclusion might be that the association between NFL and impaired rCBF exists before the clinical symptoms appear. Further longitudinal studies with a large sample size should be performed to examine the correlation between plasma NFL and rCBF in order to understand these complex relationships.",

However, the representative FC patterns during AD development for different clinical groups, especially for sMCI and pMCI, have been understudied. In this work, we integrated autoencoder and multi-class classification into a single deep model and successfully learned a set of clinical group related feature vectors. Specifically, we trained two non-linear mappings which realized the mutual transformations between the original FC space and the feature space. By mapping the learned clinical group related feature vectors to the original FC space, representative FCs were constructed for each group.

The first 50 consenting caregivers of persons with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis of BPAD, who visited the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) within 2019-2021, were included in the study. The patients were assessed on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) for the severity of the symptoms and the current level of functioning, respectively. Caregivers were assessed on the Personal Finance Well-Being Scale. In this study, the majority of caregivers were males (62%), with a median, monthly household income of Rs. 24,000, and expenditure of Rs. 12,000. The median cost of medicine was Rs. 1000 per month. The majority (64%) of patients did not have any health insurance. A total of 28 (56%) caregivers reported the cost of damage due to illness behavior. It was found that the severity of illness and current level of functioning had a significant negative correlation with caregivers' burden. The financial well-being as reflected through income and health expenditure did not have a significant correlation with the caregivers' burden. Caregivers of persons with BPAD meet the treatment expenditure out of their pocket. Though they have the financial burden, it is the illness severity and functioning capacities that are associated with caregivers' burden. These findings have implications for mental health care in persons with BPAD.",

        "AbstractText": "Although diverse language deficits have been widely observed in prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying nature of such deficits and their explanation remains opaque. Consequently, both clinical applications and brain-language models are not well-defined. In this paper we report results from two experiments which test language production in a group of individuals with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) in contrast to healthy aging and healthy young. The experiments apply factorial designs informed by linguistic analysis to test two forms of complex sentences involving anaphora (relations between pronouns and their antecedents). Results show that aMCI individuals differentiate forms of anaphora depending on sentence structure, with selective impairment of sentences which involve construal with reference to context (anaphoric coreference). We argue that aMCI individuals maintain core structural knowledge while evidencing deficiency in syntax-semantics integration, thus locating the source of the deficit in the language-thought interface of the Language Faculty.",

Since the nature of the irreversible pathology of AD, early diagnosis provides a more tractable way for disease intervention and treatment. Therefore, numerous approaches have been developed for early diagnostic purposes. Although several important biomarkers have been established, most of the existing methods show limitations in describing the continuum of AD progression. However, understanding this continuous development is essential to understand the intrinsic progression mechanism of AD. In this work, we proposed a supervised deep tree model (SDTree) to integrate AD progression and individual prediction. The proposed SDTree method models the progression of AD as a tree embedded in a latent space using nonlinear reversed graph embedding. In this way, the continuum of AD progression is encoded into the locations on the tree structure. The learned tree structure can not only represent the continuum of AD but make predictions for new subjects. We evaluated our method on the classification task and achieved promising results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.",

We aimed to quantitatively review the traditional raw learning slope (RLS), and the newly created learning ratio (LR) to understand the effects of demographic variables and clinical diagnoses on learning slope (e.g., limited improvement over multiple trials), and to develop demographically sensitive norms. A systematic literature search was conducted to evaluate the potential for these aims to be examined across the most popular contemporary multi-trial learning tests. Two databases were searched. Following this, hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine how demographic variables predict learning slope indices. These results were in turn used to contrast the performance of clinical groups with the predicted performance of demographically similar healthy controls. Finally, preliminary normative estimates for learning slope indices were presented. A total of 82 studies met criteria for inclusion in this study. However, the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) was the only test to have sufficient trial-level learning and demographic data. Fifty-eight samples from 19 studies were quantitatively examined. Hierarchical linear models provided evidence of sex differences and a curvilinear decline in learning slope with age, with strongest and most consistent effects for LR relative to RLS. Regression-based norms for demographically corrected RLS and LR scores for the RAVLT are presented. The effect of clinical diagnoses was consistently stronger for LR, and Alzheimer's disease had the strongest effect, followed by invalid performances, severe traumatic brain injury, and seizures/epilepsy. Overall, LR enjoys both conceptual and demonstrated psychometric advantages over RLS. Replication of these findings can be completed by reanalyzing existing datasets.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous age-dependent neurodegenerative disorder. Its hallmarks involve abnormal proteostasis, which triggers proteotoxicity and induces neuronal dysfunction. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic nanomachine of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and contributes to eliminating these abnormal proteins. This study focused on the relationship between proteasome and AD, the hub genes of proteasome, PSMC6, and 7 genes of \u03b1-ring, are selected as targets to study. The following three characteristics were observed: 1. The total number of proteasomes decreased with AD progression because the proteotoxicity damaged the expression of proteasome proteins, as evidenced by the downregulation of hub genes. 2. The existing proteasomes exhibit increased activity and efficiency to counterbalance the decline in total proteasome numbers, as evidenced by enhanced global coordination and reduced systemic disorder of proteasomal subunits as AD advances. 3. The synergy of PSMC6 and \u03b1-ring subunits is associated with AD. Synergistic downregulation of PSMC6 and \u03b1-ring subunits reflects a high probability of AD risk. Regarding the above discovery, the following hypothesis is proposed: The aggregation of pathogenic proteins intensifies with AD progression, then proteasome becomes more active and facilitates the UPS selectively targets the degradation of abnormal proteins to maintain CNS proteostasis. In this paper, bioinformatics and support vector machine learning methods are applied and combined with multivariate statistical analysis of microarray data. Additionally, the concept of entropy was used to detect the disorder of proteasome system, it was discovered that entropy is down-regulated continually with AD progression against system chaos caused by AD. Another conception of the matrix determinant was used to detect the global coordination of proteasome, it was discovered that the coordination is enhanced to maintain the efficiency of degradation. The features of entropy and determinant suggest that active proteasomes resist the attack caused by AD like defenders, on the one hand, to protect themselves (entropy reduces), and on the other hand, to fight the enemy (determinant reduces). It is noted that these are results from biocomputing and need to be supported by further biological experiments.",

A sample of 253 aMCI (stable, converter) individuals were included. We explored the predictive accuracy of four predictors (gait profile plus MMSE, DSST, and TMT-B) previously identified as critical for the conversion from aMCI to AD within a 36-month follow-up. Supervised ML algorithms (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors) were trained on 70% of the dataset, and feature importance was evaluated for the best algorithm. The SVM algorithm achieved the best performance. The optimized training set performance achieved an accuracy of 0.67 (sensitivity = 0.72; specificity = 0.60), improving to 0.70 on the test set (sensitivity = 0.79; specificity = 0.52). Feature importance revealed MMSE as the most important predictor in both training and testing, while gait type was important in the testing phase. We created a predictive ML model that is capable of identifying aMCI at high risk of AD dementia within 36 months. Our ML model could be used to quickly identify individuals at higher risk of AD, facilitating secondary prevention (e.g., cognitive and/or physical training), and serving as screening for more expansive and invasive tests.

Additionally, dementia often includes behavioral symptoms that increase the likelihood that an individual's actions may violate social norms and in some circumstances be deemed criminal. Prior studies have established criminal behavior as a trend among individuals living with dementia. Yet, the criminal system has yet to establish protections for individuals who commit a crime while impaired by dementia.

However, the practical utility of this approach is often limited because dependent variables are often highly skewed and fail to meet the assumption of normality. Applying linear regression analyses to highly skewed datasets can generate imprecise results, which lead to erroneous estimates derived from statistical models. Furthermore, the presence of outliers can introduce unwanted bias, which affect estimates derived from linear regression models. Although a variety of data transformations can be utilized to mitigate these problems, these approaches are also associated with various caveats. By contrast, a robust regression approach does not impose distributional assumptions on data allowing for results to be interpreted in a similar manner to that derived using a linear regression analysis. Here, we demonstrate the utility of applying robust regression to the analysis of data derived from studies of human brain neurodegeneration where the error distribution of a dependent variable does not meet the assumption of normality. We show that the application of a robust regression approach to two independent published human clinical neuropathologic data sets provides reliable estimates of associations.

Methods: We retrieved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data regarding human fibrovascular membrane (FVM) of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and human hippocampus vessels of AD from the NCBI-GEO database. GSEA analysis was performed to analyze AD-related genes in endothelial cells and pericytes of PDR. CellChat was used for predicting cell-cell communication and the signaling pathway. Results: The data suggested that amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) signaling was found crucial in the vasculature of PDR and AD. Endothelial cells and pericytes could pose influences on other cells mainly via APP signaling in PDR.

This study aimed to investigate the link between brain structural features including cortical and subcortical volume with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in elderly individuals. A total of 221 healthy subjects without any cognitive impairment with a mean age of 63.7 \u00b1 6.1 were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Overall, 87 vaccine-hesitant (VH) and 134 vaccine-accepted (VA) were entered into this study. The difference in the volume of cortical and subcortical regions was investigated between VH and VA groups. There was no significant difference in cognitive status measured by MMSE, MoCA, ADAS-cog, and RAVLT between VA and VH groups (P>0.05). The analysis showed that VA subjects had significantly higher left pars orbitalis (P: 0.013), left precentral (P: 0.042), right caudal anterior cingulate (P: 0.044), and right isthmus cingulate (P: 0.013) volume compared to the VH group. There was no significant difference in other cortical and subcortical regions. In conclusion, this finding demonstrated that in the era of complicated decision-making due to social media reports, elderly adults with smaller frontal and cingulate regions are more likely to be vaccine-hesitant. These findings can highlight the link between cortical regions and health-protective behaviors such as taking up the offer of vaccination.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases and the leading factor in dementia in the elderly. We examined the impact of Rn on scopolamine (Sco)-induced dementia in rats. Thirty-two albino male rats were divided into four groups: control, Rn, Sco, and Rn\u2009+\u2009Sco. A significant decrease in the escape latency in the Morris water maze test after pre-treatment with Rn explained better learning and memory in rats. Additionally, Rn significantly upregulated the activities of the antioxidant enzymes in the treated group compared to the Sco group but substantially reduced acetylcholinesterase activity levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, Rn dramatically reduced interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 and upregulated the gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Furthermore, in the Sco group, the hippocampal tissue's immunohistochemical reaction of Tau and glial factor activating protein (GFAP) was significantly increased in addition to the upregulation of the Caspase-3 gene expression, which was markedly improved by pre-treatment with Rn. The majority of pyramidal neurons had large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and appeared to be more or less normal, reflecting the all-beneficial effects of Rn when the hippocampal tissue was examined under a microscope. Our findings indicated that Rn, through its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as the control of the expression of GFAP, BDNF, and Tau proteins, has a novel neuroprotective impact against scopolamine-induced dementia in rats.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurologic disease and the most common cause of dementia. Classic pathology in AD is characterized by inflammation, abnormal presence of tau protein, and aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid that disrupt normal neuronal function and lead to cell death. Deficits in communication also occur during disease progression and significantly reduce health, well-being, and quality of life. Because clinical diagnosis occurs in the mid-stage of the disease, characterizing the prodrome and early stages in humans is currently challenging. To overcome these challenges, we use the validated TgF344-AD (F344-Tg(Prp-APP, Prp-PS1)19/Rrrc) transgenic rat model that manifests cognitive, behavioral, and neuropathological dysfunction akin to AD in humans. The overarching goal of our work is to test the central hypothesis that pathology and related behavioral deficits such as communication dysfunction in part manifest in the peripheral nervous system and corresponding target tissues already in the early stages. The primary aims of this study are to test the hypotheses that: (1) changes in ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) occur in the prodromal stage at 6\u2009months of age and worsen at 9\u2009months of age, (2) inflammation as well as AD-related pathology can be found in the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) at 12\u2009months of age (experimental endpoint tissue harvest), and to (3) demonstrate that the TgF344-AD rat model is an appropriate model for preclinical investigations of early AD-related vocal deficits. USVs were collected from male TgF344-AD (N\u2009=\u200919) and wildtype (WT) Fischer-344 rats (N\u2009=\u200919) at 6 months (N\u2009=\u200938; WT: n\u2009=\u200919; TgF344-AD: n\u2009=\u200919) and 9 months of age (N\u2009=\u200918; WT: n\u2009=\u200910; TgF344-AD: n\u2009=\u20098) and acoustically analyzed for duration, mean power, principal frequency, low frequency, high frequency, peak frequency, and call type. RT-qPCR was used to assay peripheral inflammation and AD-related pathology via gene expressions in the TA muscle of male TgF344-AD rats (n\u2009=\u20096) and WT rats (n\u2009=\u20096) at 12\u2009months of age. This study revealed a significant reduction in mean power of ultrasonic calls from 6 to 9\u2009months of age and increased peak frequency levels over time in TgF344-AD rats compared to WT controls. Additionally, significant downregulation of AD-related genes Uqcrc2, Bace2, Serpina3n, and Igf2, as well as downregulation of pro-inflammatory gene Myd88 was found in the TA muscle of TgF344-AD rats at 12\u2009months of age. Our findings demonstrate early and progressive vocal deficits in the TgF344-AD rat model. We further provide evidence of dysregulation of AD-pathology-related genes as well as inflammatory genes in the TA muscles of TgF344-AD rats in the early stage of the disease, confirming this rat model for early-stage investigations of voice deficits and related pathology.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of MKP-1 on AD have not been extensively studied. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, thereby repressing mRNA translation. Here, we reported that the microRNA-429-3p (miR-429-3p) was significantly increased in the brain of APP23/PS45 AD model mice and N2AAPP AD model cells. We further found that miR-429-3p could downregulate MKP-1 expression by directly binding to its 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR). Inhibition of\u00a0miR-429-3p by its antagomir (A-miR-429) restored the expression of MKP-1 to a control level and consequently reduced the amyloidogenic processing of APP and A\u03b2 accumulation. More importantly,\u00a0intranasal administration of A-miR-429 successfully ameliorated the deficits of hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation and spatial learning and memory in AD model mice by suppressing extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2)-mediated GluA1 hyperphosphorylation at Ser831 site, thereby increasing the surface expression of GluA1-containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs).

Extensive genome-wide association studies have established a distinct susceptibility link between the protein tyrosine kinase 2\u03b2 (PTK2B) gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but the specific pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. PTK2B is known to be expressed in neurons, and recent research has revealed its more important significance in microglia. Elucidating the role of PTK2B high expression in microglia in AD's progression is crucial for uncovering novel pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. Our review of existing studies suggests a close relationship between PTK2B/proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and tau pathology, and this process might be \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) dependence. Pyk2 is hypothesized as a pivotal target linking A\u03b2 and tau pathologies. Concurrently, A\u03b2-activated Pyk2 participates in the regulation of microglial activation and its proinflammatory functions. Consequently, it is reasonable to presume that Pyk2 in microglia contributes to amyloid-induced tau pathology in AD via a neuroinflammatory pathway. Furthermore, many things remain unclear, such as identifying the specific pathways that lead to the release of downstream inflammatory factors due to Pyk2 phosphorylation and whether all types of inflammatory factors can activate neuronal kinase pathways. Additionally, further in vivo experiments are essential to validate this hypothesized pathway. Considering PTK2B/Pyk2's potential role in AD pathogenesis, targeting this pathway may offer innovative and promising therapeutic approaches for AD.",

The EMD provides a granular, noise-resistant, and rate-robust description of remapping. This approach enables the identification of specific cell types and the characterization of remapping in various scenarios, including disease models. Furthermore, the EMD's properties can be manipulated to identify spatially tuned cell types and to explore remapping as it relates to alternate information forms such as spatiotemporal coding. We present a feasible, lightweight approach that complements traditional methods. Our findings underscore the potential of the EMD as a powerful tool for enhancing our understanding of remapping in the brain and its implications for spatial navigation, memory studies and beyond.",

        "AbstractText": "Accurate modelling of molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for understanding the mechanisms driving neuronal pathology and for developing treatments. Synaptic dysfunction has long been implicated as a mechanism underpinning memory dysfunction in AD and may result in part from changes in adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) mediated RNA editing of the GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors and changes in AMPA receptor function at the post synaptic cleft. However, few studies have investigated changes in proteins which influence RNA editing and notably, AD studies that focus on studying changes in protein expression, rather than changes in mRNA, often use traditional western blotting. Here, we demonstrate the value of automated capillary western blotting to investigate the protein expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluA1-4), the ADAR RNA editing proteins (ADAR1-3), and proteins known to regulate RNA editing (PIN1, WWP2, FXR1P, and CREB1), in the J20 AD mouse model. We describe extensive optimisation and validation of the automated capillary western blotting method, demonstrating the use of total protein to normalise protein load, in addition to characterising the optimal protein/antibody concentrations to ensure accurate protein quantification. Following this, we assessed changes in proteins of interest in the hippocampus of 44-week-old J20 AD mice. We observed an increase in the expression of ADAR1 p110 and GluA3 and a decrease in ADAR2 in the hippocampus of 44-week-old J20 mice. These changes signify a shift in the balance of proteins that play a critical role at the synapse. Regression analysis revealed unique J20-specific correlations between changes in AMPA receptor subunits, ADAR enzymes, and proteins that regulate ADAR stability in J20 mice, highlighting potential mechanisms mediating RNA-editing changes found in AD. Our findings in J20 mice generally reflect changes seen in the human AD brain. This study underlines the importance of novel techniques, like automated capillary western blotting, to assess protein expression in AD. It also provides further evidence to support the hypothesis that a dysregulation in RNA editing-related proteins may play a role in the initiation and/or progression of AD.",

When facing a memory complaint, the primary care consultation has four objectives: to identify the possible red flags amongst the memory complaint and the memory complaint severity, to objectify a neurocognitive disorder associated with the memory complaint using cognitive tests, to search for associated signs, and to screen for obvious, frequent, and curable causes of memory complaint. The article is intended to be a practical tool aligned with the 2018 French multidisciplinary recommendations regarding the graded and personalized strategy for diagnosing neurocognitive disorders. It details the possibly worrisome elements to be collected in the history, the elements that need special attention or assessment, and finally, the course of action to be taken after a primary care consultation.",

        "AbstractText": "MEMORY DISEASES. There are many diseases that permanently affect longterm memory and all of them have in common that they permanently and usually bilaterally disrupt specific neural circuits that underlie it. In the forefront is the Papez circuit, or hippocampo-mamillo-thalamo-cingular circuit, which is also connected to the fronto-basal regions. Its impairment leads to disorders of episodic memory, with relative preservation of semantic memory and implicit learning. The anterior temporal pole is a hub allowing access to general knowledge distributed in the cortex. Its damage results in an amnesic picture in which the loss of semantic memory dominates. The richness of memory disorders is largely deduced, in its nuances, from the lesion topographies. The most frequent aetiology of memory diseases is represented by neurodegenerative diseases, dominated by Alzheimer's disease, but the semiology of these is by far not limited to a memory disorder, because of the diffusion of lesions. Dysimmune, infectious or toxic encephalitis affecting the hippocampi, Korsakoff's syndrome affecting the thalamus and mamillary bodies, \u00ab semantic dementia \u00bb affecting the temporal pole, give pictures where memory disorders are in the foreground with remarkable semiological nuances. Post-traumatic amnesia, due to the heterogeneity of the lesions, offers a more complex picture, where memory disorders are complemented by executive disorders, sometimes major.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Berberis vulgaris, which possesses a variety of pharmacological activities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease with multiple pathologic factors, with cognitive decline being the main manifestation of AD. The neuroprotective effects of berberine in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been widely reported, exhibiting protective effects against risk factors associated with AD. In this study, we summarize and evaluate the effects of berberine on cognitive function and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein in animal models of AD. Material and methods: Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to 1 June 2023. Risk of bias was assessed by the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experiments (SYRCLE). Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 and Review Manger 5.4 software to calculate weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), Morris water maze (MWM) test and \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein as outcome measures. Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 test. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also assessed. Results: 19 studies involving 360 animals met the inclusion criteria, and the results of the meta-analysis showed that berberine decreased escape latency (SMD = -2.19, 95% CI: (-2.50, -1.88), p < 0.00001), increased the number of platform crossings (SMD = 4.27, 95% CI (3.38, 5.17), p < 0.00001), time in the target quadrant (SMD = 5.92, 95% CI (4.43, 7.41), p < 0.00001) and APP expression (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: (0.25, 1.21), p = 0.003). Conclusion: Berberine can regulate APP expression and improve cognitive function in animal models of AD, and the mechanism may be related to the involvement of berberine in APP processing and influence the expression of its related factors.

However, rigorous study of ELN vesicles in AD and aged control brains poses a unique constellation of methodological challenges due in part to the small size of these structures and subsequent requirements for high-resolution imaging. Here we provide a detailed protocol for high-resolution 3D morphological quantification of neuronal endosomes in postmortem AD brain tissue, using immunofluorescent staining, confocal imaging with image deconvolution, and Imaris software analysis pipelines. To demonstrate these methods, we present neuronal endosome morphology data from 23 sporadic LOAD donors and one aged non-AD control donor. The techniques described here were developed across a range of AD neuropathology to best optimize these methods for future studies with large cohorts.

One of the causes is the inability of the substance to reach the brain in therapeutic quantities. These pharmaceuticals lacked targeted mechanisms for drug delivery, coming about in an elevated drug concentration in imperative organs, which drove to drug harmfulness. In recent years, cell-free treatment (conditioned medium) determined from animal and human stem cells has provided new promise for treating brain diseases, as CM can stimulate the regeneration of neurons and prevent the inflammation and apoptotic of neurons caused by pathology or aging. On the other hand, it is well known that chitosan-hydrogel (CH) is a polymer derived from natural sources. It has been authorized for use in biomedical use because of its uncommon biodegradability, biocompatibility, and mucoadhesive properties. CH modification has been utilized to generate nanoparticles (NPs) for intranasal and intravenous brain targeting. NPs shown upgraded drug take-up to the brain with decreased side impacts due to their drawn out contact time with the nasal mucosa, surface charge, nanosize, and capacity to extend the tight intersections inside the mucosa.

This paper reports the creation and characterization of a triangular A\u03b2 trimer mimic composed of A\u03b217-36 \u03b2-hairpins and the generation and study of polyclonal antibodies raised against the A\u03b2 trimer mimic. The A\u03b2 trimer mimic is covalently stabilized by three disulfide bonds at the corners of the triangular trimer to create a homogeneous oligomer. Structural, biophysical, and cell-based studies demonstrate that the A\u03b2 trimer mimic shares characteristics with oligomers of full-length A\u03b2. X-ray crystallography elucidates the structure of the trimer and reveals that four copies of the trimer assemble to form a dodecamer. SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and dynamic light scattering reveal that the trimer also forms higher-order assemblies in solution. Cell-based toxicity assays show that the trimer elicits LDH release, decreases ATP levels, and activates caspase-3/7 mediated apoptosis. Immunostaining studies on brain slices from people who lived with Alzheimer's disease and people who lived with Down syndrome reveal that the polyclonal antibodies raised against the A\u03b2 trimer mimic recognize pathological features including different types of A\u03b2 plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy.",

        "AbstractText": "The self-assembly of A\u03b2 peptides into toxic oligomers and fibrils is the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the conformational transition from helix to sheet is considered a crucial step in the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides. However, the structural details of this process still remain unclear due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of the A\u03b2 peptides. In this study, we developed an enhanced sampling strategy that combines artificial neural networks (ANN) with metadynamics to explore the conformational space of the A\u03b242 peptides. The strategy consists of two parts: applying ANN to optimize CVs and conducting metadynamics based on the resulting CVs to sample conformations. The results showed that this strategy achieved better sampling performance in terms of the distribution of sampled conformations. The sampling efficiency is increased by 10-fold compared to our previous Hamiltonian Exchange Molecular Dynamics (MD) and by 1000-fold compared to ordinary MD. Based on the sampled conformations, we constructed a Markov state model to understand the detailed transition process. The intermediate states in this process are identified, and the connecting paths are analyzed. The conformational transitions in D23-K28 and M35-V40 are proven to be crucial for aggregation. These results are helpful in clarifying the mechanism and process of A\u03b242 peptide aggregation. D23-K28 and M35-V40 can be identified as potential targets for screening and designing inhibitors of A\u03b2 peptide aggregation.",

However, to date all haplotype-disease associations have not excluded recombination interference among multiple loci and hence some results might be confounded by recombination interference. Association of sister haplotypes with a complex disease, based on recombination disequilibrium (RD) was presented. Sister haplotypes can be determined by translating notation of DNA base haplotypes to notation of genetic genotypes. Sister haplotypes provide haplotype pairs available for haplotype-disease association analysis. After performing RD tests in control and case cohorts, a two-by-two contingency table can be constructed using sister haplotype pair and case-control pair. With this standard two-by-two table, one can perform classical Chi-square test to find statistical haplotype-disease association. Applying this method to a haplotype dataset of Alzheimer disease (AD), association of sister haplotypes containing ApoE3/4 with risk for AD was identified under no RD. Haplotypes within gene IL-13 were not associated with risk for breast cancer in the case of no RD and no association of haplotypes in gene IL-17A with risk for coronary artery disease were detected without RD. The previously reported associations of haplotypes within these genes with risk for these diseases might be due to strong RD and/or inappropriate haplotype pairs.",

Despite significant clinical advancements in stroke therapy, stroke remains a prominent contributor to both mortality and disability worldwide. Brain injury resulting from an ischemic stroke is a dynamic process that unfolds over time. Initially, an infarct core forms due to the abrupt and substantial blockage of blood flow. In the subsequent hours to days, the surrounding tissue undergoes gradual deterioration, primarily driven by sustained hypoperfusion, programmed cell death, and inflammation. While anti-inflammatory strategies have proven highly effective in experimental models of stroke, their successful translation to clinical use has proven challenging. To overcome this translational hurdle, a better understanding of the distinct immune response driving ischemic stroke brain injury is needed. In this review article, we give an overview of current knowledge regarding the immune response in ischemic stroke and the contribution of immunothrombosis to this process. We discuss therapeutic approaches to overcome detrimental immunothrombosis in ischemic stroke and how these can be extrapolated to other neurovascular diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.

Participants (N = 13,952) aged 55+ had complete lifetime trauma and cognitive testing data at the 2006/08, 2010/12, and/or 2014/16 waves. Trauma indices comprised childhood and adulthood event counts. Outcomes included baseline performance and trajectories on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status. Main and nonlinear trauma effects were modeled via linear regression, and overall contributions assessed with omnibus likelihood ratio tests. Black participants (N = 2,345) reported marginally lower adulthood trauma exposure than White participants (N = 11,607) with no other exposure differentials observed. In White participants only, greater childhood trauma exposure predicted worse baseline cognition but slower change over time. Across race, adulthood trauma robustly associated with baseline cognition. Relationships were frequently nonlinear: low but nonzero trauma predicted highest cognitive scores, with much poorer cognition observed as trauma exposure increased. Relationships between adulthood trauma and trajectory were limited to the White sample. Traumatic experiences, particularly in adulthood, may impact late-life cognitive health if not addressed.

Additionally, this study sought to identify the comparative prevalence of AD and/or dementia in patients with an autoimmune disorder who were using disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) compared to those not using DMARDs. Cross-sectional secondary data analyses were conducted on Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data from 2017 and 2018. The MCBS data consists of a nationally representative sample of the Medicare population, a population that is largely 65 and older, and provides de-identified patient information. Patients from this dataset with a self-reported autoimmune disorder were included in the analyses. Descriptive analyses were conducted on demographic variables, chronic conditions, and medication use. The prevalence of AD and/or dementia was compared between patients with and without an autoimmune disorder. A backward stepwise selection regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with the prevalence of AD and/or dementia. The study included 18,929 Medicare beneficiaries, with 4,405 identified as having one autoimmune disorder. The prevalence of AD and/or dementia was significantly higher in patients with an autoimmune disorder.

Presently, the most well-studied biomarkers for AD diagnosis are three phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau): p-Tau231, p-Tau217, and p-Tau181. Glycogen synthase-3beta (GSK3\u03b2)-phosphorated Tau-441 is the most commonly used calibrator for p-Tau immunoassays. However, the batch-to-batch inconsistency issue of the commonly used GSK3\u03b2-phosphorylated Tau-441 limits its clinical application. We have successfully generated and characterized 61 Tau monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with distinct epitopes by using the hybridoma technique and employed them as capture or detection antibodies for p-Tau immunoassays. Through chemical synthesis, we synthesized calibrators, which are three peptides including capture and detection antibody epitopes, for application in immunoassays that detect p-Tau231, p-Tau217, and p-Tau181. The novel calibrators were applied to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Single-molecule array (Simoa) platforms to validate their applicability and establish a range of p-Tau immunoassays. By employing the hybridoma technique, 49 mAbs recognizing Tau (1-22), nine mAbs targeting p-Tau231, one mAb targeting p-Tau217, and two mAbs targeting p-Tau181 were developed. Peptides, including recognition epitopes of capture and detection antibodies, were synthesized. These peptides were used as calibrators to develop 60 immunoassays on the ELISA platform, of which six highly sensitive immunoassays were selected and applied to the ultra-sensitive Simoa platform.

The primary objective of this review is to gather, synthesize, and consolidate scientifically proven evidence on the impact of CBD on brain function and its therapeutic significance in treating neurological and mental disorders. First, basic background information on CBD, including its biomolecular properties and mechanisms of action is presented. Next, evidence for CBD effects in the human brain is provided followed by a discussion on the potential implications of CBD as a neurotherapeutic agent. The potential effectiveness of CBD in reducing chronic pain is considered but also in reducing the symptoms of various brain disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the implications of using CBD to manage psychiatric conditions such as psychosis, anxiety and fear, depression, and substance use disorders are explored. An overview of the beneficial effects of CBD on aspects of human behavior, such as sleep, motor control, cognition and memory, is then provided. As CBD products remain largely unregulated, it is crucial to address the ethical concerns associated with their use, including product quality, consistency, and safety. Therefore, this review discusses the need for responsible research and regulation of CBD to ensure its safety and efficacy as a therapeutic agent for brain disorders or to stimulate behavioral and cognitive abilities of healthy individuals.",

Results: A total of sixteen eligible and relevant studies involving 1103 AD participants were included. The combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs was superior to single conventional drugs in MMSE [MD = 2.57, 95%CI: (1.44, 3.69); p < 0.00001; I 2 = 86%], ADL [MD = -3.19, 95%CI: (-4.29, -2.09); p < 0.00001; I 2 = 0%], and ADAS-cog scores [MD = -2.09, 95%CI: (-3.07, -1.10); p < 0.0001; I 2 = 0%]. The combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs had a significantly more favorable benefit in clinical effectiveness [RR = 1.27, 95%CI: (1.12, 1.44); p = 0.0002; I 2 = 0%]. Adverse events were not increased with the combination of PT and AT plus conventional drugs compared to conventional drugs [RR = 0.65, 95%CI: (0.35, 1.19); p = 0.16; I 2 = 0%]. The experimental group treated with the combination of PT and AT alone for AD was comparable in MMSE, ADL, and ADAS-cog scores compared with the control group treated with single conventional drugs. Conclusion: Compared to single conventional drugs, the combination of PT and AT may be used as an alternative therapy to improve global cognition and functioning in AD, and the combination of PT and AT as adjunctive therapy appears to produce a better therapeutic response to AD in terms of efficacy without increasing the risk of adverse events. However, the very low to low quality of available evidence limits confidence in the findings. Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42023444156.",

        "AbstractText": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder, currently lacks effective clinical therapeutics. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) holds promising potential in AD treatment, exemplified by Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS), a TCM formulation. The precise therapeutic mechanisms of DSS in AD remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to uncover the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of DSS in AD, employing an integrative approach encompassing gut microbiota and metabolomic analyses. Methods: Thirty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were allocated into three groups: Blank Control (Con), AD Model (M), and Danggui Shaoyao San (DSS). AD models were established via bilateral intracerebroventricular injections of streptozotocin (STZ). DSS was orally administered at 24\u00a0g\u00b7kg-1\u00b7d-1 (weight of raw herbal materials) for 14 days. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. Pathological alterations were assessed through hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Bloodstream metabolites were characterized, gut microbiota profiled through 16S rDNA sequencing, and cortical metabolomics analyzed. Hippocampal proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) were quantified using RT-qPCR, and oxidative stress markers (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX, MDA) in brain tissues were measured with biochemical assays. Results: DSS identified a total of 1,625 bloodstream metabolites, predominantly Benzene derivatives, Carboxylic acids, and Fatty Acyls. DSS significantly improved learning and spatial memory in AD rats and ameliorated cerebral tissue pathology. The formulation enriched the probiotic Ligilactobacillus, modulating metabolites like Ophthalmic acid (OA), Phosphocreatine (PCr), Azacridone A, Inosine, and NAD. DSS regulated Purine and Nicotinate-nicotinamide metabolism, restoring balance in the Candidatus Saccharibacteria-OA interplay and stabilizing gut microbiota-metabolite homeostasis. Additionally, DSS reduced hippocampal IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 expression, attenuating the inflammatory state. It elevated antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-PX) while reducing MDA levels, indicating diminished oxidative stress in AD rat brains. Conclusion: DSS addresses AD pathology through multifaceted mechanisms, encompassing gut microbiome regulation, specific metabolite modulation, and the mitigation of inflammation and oxidative stress within the brain. This holistic intervention through the Microbial-Gut-Brain Axis (MGBA) underscores DSS's potential as an integrative therapeutic agent in combatting AD.",

        "AbstractText": "A\u03b21-40 peptide and A\u03b21-42 peptide are the building units of beta-amyloid plaques present in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-affected brain. The binding affinity of various divalent metal ions such as Cu and Zn present in AD-affected brain with different amino acids available in A\u03b2-peptide became the focus to explore their role in soluble neurotoxic oligomer formation. Cu2+ metal ions are known to enhance the neurotoxicity of the A\u03b21-42 peptide by catalyzing the formation of soluble neurotoxic oligomers. The competitive preference of both Cu2+ and Zn2+ simultaneously to interact with the A\u03b2-peptide is unknown. The divalent Cu and Zn ions were inserted in explicit aqueous A\u03b21-42 peptide configurations to get insights into the binding competence of these metal ions with peptides using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The metal-ion interactions reveal that competitive binding preferences of various peptide sites become metal-ion-specific and differ significantly. For Cu2+, interactions are found to be more significant with respect to those of Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-14. Asp-1, Glu-3, Asp-7, His-6, Glu-11, and His-13 amino acid residues show higher affinity toward Zn2+ ions. MD simulations show notable variation in the solvent-accessible surface area in the hydrophobic region of the peptide. Infinitesimal mobility was obtained for Zn2+ compared to Cu2+ in an aqueous solution and Cu2+ diffusivity deviated significantly at different time scales, proving its labile features in aqueous A\u03b21-42 peptides.",

Classification by conceptual-semantic impairment may be more informative. This study examined the effects of conceptual-semantic impairment and diagnostic subtype on anomia treatment effects in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). At baseline, the picture and word versions of the Pyramids and Palm Trees and Kissing and Dancing tests were used to measure conceptual-semantic processing. Based on norming that was conducted with unimpaired older adults, participants were classified as being impaired on both the picture and word versions (i.e., modality-general conceptual-semantic impairment), the picture version (Objects or Actions) only (i.e., visual-conceptual impairment), the word version (Nouns or Verbs) only (i.e., lexical-semantic impairment), or neither the picture nor the word version (i.e., no impairment). Following baseline testing, a lexical treatment and a semantic treatment were administered to all participants. The treatment stimuli consisted of nouns and verbs that were consistently named correctly at baseline (Prophylaxis items) and/or nouns and verbs that were consistently named incorrectly at baseline (Remediation items). Naming accuracy was measured at baseline, and it was measured at three, seven, eleven, fourteen, eighteen, and twenty-one months. Compared to baseline naming performance, lexical and semantic treatments both improved naming accuracy for treated Remediation nouns and verbs. For Prophylaxis items, lexical treatment was effective for both nouns and verbs, and semantic treatment was effective for verbs, but the pattern of results was different for nouns -- the effect of semantic treatment was initially nonsignificant or marginally significant, but it was significant beginning at 11 Months, suggesting that the effects of prophylactic semantic treatment may become more apparent as the disorder progresses. Furthermore, the interaction between baseline Conceptual-Semantic Impairment and the Treatment Condition (Lexical vs. Semantic) was significant for verb Prophylaxis items at 3 and 18 Months, and it was significant for noun Prophylaxis items at 14 and 18 Months. The pattern of results suggested that individuals who have modality-general conceptual-semantic impairment at baseline are more likely to benefit from lexical treatment, while individuals who have unimpaired conceptual-semantic processing at baseline are more likely to benefit from semantic treatment as the disorder progresses. In contrast to conceptual-semantic impairment, diagnostic subtype did not typically predict the treatment effects.",

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been identified as a novel potential therapeutic target for AD due to its unique role in energy metabolism. Electroacupuncture (EA) shows promise in improving cognitive ability and brain glucose metabolism in AD, but its effects on peripheral and central metabolism are unclear. In this study, SAMP8 mice (AD model) received EA stimulation at specific acupoints. Cognitive abilities were evaluated using the Morris water maze test, while neuronal morphology and tau pathology were assessed through Nissl staining and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. Metabolic variations and BAT thermogenesis were measured using ELISA, HE staining, Western blotting, and infrared thermal imaging. Compared to SAMR1 mice, SAMP8 mice showed impaired cognitive ability, neuronal damage, disrupted thermoregulation, and metabolic disorders with low BAT activity. Both the EA and DD groups improved cognitive ability and decreased tau phosphorylation (p<0.01 or p<0.05). However, only the EA group had a significant effect on metabolic disorders and BAT thermogenesis (p<0.01 or p<0.05), while the DD group did not. These findings indicate that EA not only improves the cognitive ability of SAMP8 mice, but also effectively regulates peripheral and central metabolic disorders, with this effect being significantly related to the activation of BAT thermogenesis.",

        "AbstractText": "The design of multi-center study is increasingly used for borrowing strength from multiple research groups to obtain broadly applicable and reproducible study findings. Regression analysis is widely used for analyzing multi-group studies, however, some of the large number of regression predictors are nonlinear and/or often measured with batch effects in many large scale collaborative studies. Also, the group compositions of the nonlinear predictors are potentially heterogeneous across different centers. The conventional pooled data analysis ignores the interplay between nonlinearity and batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, measurement error and other data incoherence in multi-center setting that can cause biased regression estimates and misleading outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated partially linear regression model (IPLM) based analysis to account for the predictor's nonlinearity, general batch effect, group composition heterogeneity, high-dimensional covariates, potential measurement-error in covariates, and combinations of these complexities simultaneously. A local linear regression based approach is employed to estimate the nonlinear component and a regularization procedure is introduced to identify the predictors' effects that can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous across groups. In particular, when the effects of all predictors are homogeneous across the study centers, the proposed IPLM can automatically reduce to one single parsimonious partially linear model for all centers. The proposed method has asymptotic estimation and variable selection consistency including high-dimensional covariates. Moreover, it has a fast computing algorithm and its effectiveness is supported by numerical simulation studies. A multi-center Alzheimer's disease research project is provided to illustrate the proposed IPLM based analysis.",

Clinical trials play an essential role in developing and testing new treatments for AD. However, identifying eligible participants can be challenging, time-consuming, and costly. In recent years, the development of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically named entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN), have helped to automate the identification and extraction of relevant information from the eligibility criteria (EC) more efficiently, in order to facilitate semi-automatic patient recruitment and enable data FAIRness for clinical trial data. Nevertheless, most current biomedical NER models only provide annotations for a restricted set of entity types that may not be applicable to the clinical trial data. Additionally, accurately performing NEN on entities that are negated using a negative prefix currently lacks established techniques. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline designed for information extraction from AD clinical trial EC, which involves preprocessing of the EC data, clinical NER, and biomedical NEN to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Our NER model can identify named entities in seven pre-defined categories, while our NEN model employs a combination of exact match and partial match search strategies, as well as customized rules to accurately normalize entities with negative prefixes. To evaluate the performance of our pipeline, we measured the precision, recall, and F1 score for the NER component, and we manually reviewed the top five mapping results produced by the NEN component. Our evaluation of the pipeline's performance revealed that it can successfully normalize named entities in clinical trial ECs with optimal accuracies. The NER component achieved a overall F1 of 0.816, demonstrating its ability to accurately identify seven types of named entities in clinical text. The NEN component of the pipeline also demonstrated impressive performance, with customized rules and a combination of exact and partial match strategies leading to an accuracy of 0.940 for normalized entities.",

Diesel-heavy unregulated vehicles are a key UFPM source for 21.8 million MMC residents. We found that hyperphosphorylated tau, beta amyloid1-42, \u03b1-synuclein, and TAR DNA-binding protein-43 were associated with NPs in 186 forensic autopsies (mean age 27.45\u2009\u00b1\u200911.89\u2009years).

To date, only eight AD drugs have ever gained regulatory approval, including six symptomatic and two disease-modifying drugs. However, not all are available in all countries and high costs associated with new disease-modifying biologics prevent large proportions of the patient population from accessing them. With the current patient population expected to triple by 2050, it is imperative that new, effective, and affordable drugs become available to patients. Traditional drug development strategies have a 99% failure rate in AD, which is far higher than in other disease areas.

Amyloid beta (A\u03b2), a main component of senile plaques (SPs) in AD, induces neuronal death through damage to cellular organelles and structures, caused by oxidation of important molecules such as proteins by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of the protein tau in the microtubules within the brain also promote ROS production. Methionine, a residue of proteins, is particularly sensitive to oxidation by ROS. One of the enzyme systems that reverses the oxidative damage in mammalian cells is the enzyme system known as Methionine Sulfoxide Reductases (MSRs). The components of the MSR system, namely MSRA and MSRB, reduce oxidized forms of methionine (Met-(o)) in proteins back to methionine (Met). Furthermore, the MSRs scavenge ROS by allowing methionine residues in proteins to utilize their antioxidant properties. This review aims to improve the understanding of the role of the MSR system of enzymes in reducing cellular oxidative damage and AD pathogenesis, which may contribute to effective therapeutic approaches for AD by targeting the MSR system.",

In this study, we investigated SENP1 and SUMOylation changes in the brains of aged APOE3 and APOE4 mice, aiming to understand their potential impact on mitochondrial metabolism and their contribution to cellular senescence in APOE4 mice. Concurrently, SUMO1-conjugated protein levels decreased, while SUMO2/3-conjugated protein levels increased relatively with the aging of APOE4 mice. This suggests that the equilibrium between the SUMOylation and deSUMOylation processes may be associated with senescence and longevity. Our findings highlight the significant roles of SENP1 and SUMOylation changes in APOE4-driven pathology and the aging process.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Interaction of Tau with Kinesin-1: Effect of Kinesin-1 Heavy Chain Elimination on Autophagy-Mediated Mutant Tau Degradation.",
        "AbstractText": "Natively unfolded tau has a low propensity to form aggregates, but in tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Multiple intracellular transport pathways utilize kinesin-1, a plus-end-directed microtubule-based motor. Kinesin-1 is crucial in various neurodegenerative diseases as it transports multiple cargoes along the microtubules (MT). Kinesin-1 proteins cannot progress along MTs due to an accumulation of tau on their surfaces. Although kinesin-1-mediated neuronal transport dysfunction is well-documented in other neurodegenerative diseases, its role in AD has received less attention. Very recently, we have shown that knocking down and knocking out of kinesin-1 heavy chain (KIF5B KO) expression significantly reduced the level and stability of tau in cells and tau transgenic mice, respectively. Here, we report that tau interacts with the motor domain of KIF5B in vivo and in vitro, possibly through its microtubule-binding repeat domain. This interaction leads to the inhibition of the ATPase activity of the motor domain. In addition, the KIF5B KO results in autophagy initiation, which subsequently assists in tau degradation. The mechanisms behind KIF5B KO-mediated tau degradation seem to involve its interaction with tau, promoting the trafficking of tau through retrograde transport into autophagosomes for subsequent lysosomal degradation of tau. Our results suggest how KIF5B removal facilitates the movement of autophagosomes toward lysosomes for efficient tau degradation. This mechanism can be enabled through the downregulation of kinesin-1 or the disruption of the association between kinesin-1 and tau, particularly in cases when neurons perceive disturbances in intercellular axonal transport.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaque density was examined in the amygdala of rhesus macaques, to elucidate the influence of age, diet and hormonal environment. Luminex technology was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 across three decades, while immunohistochemistry was used to examine A\u03b2 plaque density in the amygdala. A\u03b240 was found to be the predominant isoform of A\u03b2 in the CSF, but neither A\u03b240 or A\u03b242 concentrations showed an age-related change, and the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 showed only a marginal increase. Significantly fewer A\u03b2 plaques were detected in the amygdala of old ovariectomized animals if they received estradiol HRT (p < 0.001); similar results were obtained regardless of whether they had been maintained on a regular monkey chow for \u223c48 months or on a high-fat, high-sugar, Western-style diet for \u223c30 months. The results demonstrate that HRT involving estrogen can reduce A\u03b2 plaque load in a cognitive brain region of aged non-human primates. The results from this translational animal model may therefore have clinical relevance to the treatment of AD in post-menopausal women, whether used alone, or as a supplement to current pharmacological and monoclonal antibody-based interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing. African Americans are twice as likely to develop dementia than other ethnic populations. Traditional cognitive screening solutions lack the sensitivity to independently identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline. The DCTclock is a 3-min AI-enabled adaptation of the well-established clock drawing test. The DCTclock can estimate dementia risk for both general cognitive impairment and the presence of AD pathology. Here we performed a retrospective analysis to assess the performance of the DCTclock to estimate future conversion to ADRD in African American participants from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and African American Clinical Core (AACORE). We assessed baseline DCTclock scores in 646 participants (baseline median age = 78.0 \u00b1 6.4, median years of education = 14.0 \u00b1 3.2, 78% female) and found significantly lower baseline DCTclock scores in those who received a dementia diagnosis within 3 years. We also found that 16.4% of participants with a baseline DCTclock score less than 60 were significantly more likely to develop dementia in 5 years vs. those with the highest DCTclock scores (75-100). This research demonstrates the DCTclock's ability to estimate the 5-year risk of developing dementia in an African American population. Early detection of elevated dementia risk using the DCTclock could provide patients, caregivers, and clinicians opportunities to plan and intervene early to improve cognitive health trajectories. Early detection of dementia risk can also enhance participant selection in clinical trials while reducing screening costs.",

People with AD and their caregivers from 30 provincial regions in mainland China were enrolled from October 2020 to December 2020 to be surveyed for caregivers' mental states and living conditions, as well as caregivers' attitudes toward treatment and caring. Logistic regression was used to explore the factors that influence the positive and negative states of caregivers who care for people with different stages of AD. A total of 1,966 valid questionnaires were analyzed (mild AD: 795, moderate AD: 521, severe AD: 650). A total of 73.6% of caregivers maintained normal states (mild group: 71.9%, moderate group: 73.9%, severe group: 75.2%; X2\u2009=\u20092.023, p\u2009=\u20090.364), and the proportions of caregivers with positive and negative states were 26.3% (mild group: 38.4%, moderate group: 24.6%, severe group: 13.1%; X2\u2009=\u2009119.000, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 36.5% (mild group: 25.2%, moderate group: 36.9%, severe group: 50.2%; X2\u2009=\u200996.417, p\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively.

        "AbstractText": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, and is often comorbid with other neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with recurrent seizures often present with cognitive impairment. However, it is unclear how seizures, even when infrequent, produce long-lasting deficits in cognition. One mechanism may be seizure-induced expression of \u0394FosB, a long-lived transcription factor that persistently regulates expression of plasticity-related genes and drives cognitive dysfunction. We previously found that, compared with cognitively-intact subjects, the activity-dependent expression of \u0394FosB in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was increased in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in individuals with AD. In MCI patients, higher \u0394FosB expression corresponded to lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Surgically resected DG tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy also showed robust \u0394FosB expression; however, it is unclear whether \u0394FosB expression also corresponds to cognitive dysfunction in non-AD-related epilepsy. To test whether DG \u0394FosB expression is indicative of cognitive impairment in epilepsies with different etiologies, we assessed \u0394FosB expression in surgically-resected hippocampal tissue from 33 patients with childhood epilepsies who had undergone Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) testing prior to surgery. We found that \u0394FosB expression is inversely correlated with Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) in patients with mild to severe intellectual disability (FSIQ < 85). Our data indicate that \u0394FosB expression corresponds to cognitive impairment in epilepsies with different etiologies, supporting the hypothesis that \u0394FosB may epigenetically regulate gene expression and impair cognition across a wide range of epilepsy syndromes.",

We completed a thorough search on MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, APAPsycinfo, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. We identified studies that focus on written discourse performance in people with aphasia, primary progressive aphasia, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Nineteen studies were identified from the review of literature, some of which addressed more than one of our review questions. Fifteen studies included a comparison between clinical populations and controls. Six studies compared different characteristics of patient populations. Three studies reported changes over time in progressive disorders. Six studies targeted different modalities of discourse. Differences in linguistic features by patient populations are not yet clear due to the limited number of studies and different measures and tasks used across the studies. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of numerous linguistic features in acquired neurogenic communication disorders that depart from those of healthy controls. Compared to the controls, people with aphasia tend to produce fewer words, and syntactically simpler utterances compared to the controls. People with Alzheimer's disease produce less information content, and this feature increases over time, as reported in longitudinal studies. Our review imparts additional information that written and spoken discourse provide unique insights into the cognitive and linguistic deficits experienced by people with aphasia, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and primary progressive aphasia and provide targets for treatment to improve written communication in these groups.",

Methods: All ChEIs related TdP/QT prolongation cases were retrieved from the FAERS database using standard MedDRA query (SMQ) from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2022. Disproportionality and sensitivity analysis were used to determine the signal of TdP/QT prolongation related to ChEIs. Results: 557 cases of TdP/QT prolongation related to 3 ChEIs were searched by SMQ. The patients were mostly elderly people, with markedly more female than male. The signals of TdP/QT prolongation for ChEIs were detected by disproportionality analysis, and the signal of Donepezil was the strongest. The sensitivity analysis results indicate a robust and stable correlation between these signals with ChEIs. TdP/QT prolongation usually occurs within 1\u00a0month after taking ChEIs. The drug with the highest frequency of combination with donepezil and galantamine is citalopram, and the drug with the highest frequency of combination with rivastigmine is atorvastatin. Conclusion: The signals of TdP/QT prolongation related to ChEIs were strong and stable.

        "AbstractText": "We examined associations between intra-generational social mobility (reflected in life-course socioeconomic trajectories) and mortality, among older men. Data came from a prospective Australian community-based cohort of older men. Social mobility was defined by socioeconomic indicators from three points in the life-course: educational attainment (late adolescence-early adulthood), occupation (mid-life), and current sources of income (older age). We defined indicators of social mobility trajectory (6 categories; reflecting the direction of social mobility) and social mobility status (2 categories; mobile or non-mobile). We used Cox regression to examine associations with mortality, adjusting for age, country of birth, and living arrangement. We followed 1568 men (mean age 76.8, SD 5.4) for a mean duration of 9.1 years, with 797 deaths recorded. Moving upward was the predominant social mobility trajectory (36.0%), followed by mixed trajectories (25.1%), downward (15.1%), stable low (12.2%), stable high (7.6%), and stable middle (4.0%). Men with downward (Hazard ratio 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.19) and stable low socioeconomic trajectories (1.77, 1.25 to 2.50) had higher mortality risks than men with stable high socioeconomic trajectories, while men with upward trajectories had similar risks to those with stable high trajectories. 76.2% of the participants were classified as having mobile status; no associations were evident between binary social mobility status and mortality. These findings suggest cumulative and persistent exposure to disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions across the life-course, rather than social mobility, is associated with increased mortality. For each stage of the life-course, addressing socioeconomic disadvantage may reduce inequities in mortality.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to dementia and poses a serious threat to the health of the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) presents as a promising novel therapeutic therapy for preventing and treating dementia. Studies have shown that natural products derived from kidney-tonifying herbs can effectively inhibit AD. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a critical factor in the pathology of AD. Regulation of ER stress is a crucial approach to prevent and treat AD. Thus, in this study, we first collected kidney-tonifying herbs, integrated chemical ingredients from multiple TCM databases, and constructed a comprehensive drug-target network. Subsequently, we employed the endophenotype network (network proximity) method to identify potential active ingredients in kidney-tonifying herbs that prevented AD via regulating ER stress. By combining the predicted outcomes, we discovered that 32 natural products could ameliorate AD pathology via regulating ER stress. After a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-network model and systematic pharmacological analyses, we further selected several promising compounds for in vitro testing in the APP-SH-SY5Y cell model. Experimental results showed that echinacoside and danthron were able to effectively reduce ER stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the expression levels of BIP, p-PERK, ATF6, and CHOP in APP-SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, this study utilized the endophenotype network to preliminarily decipher the effective material basis and potential molecular mechanism of kidney-tonifying Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a long preclinical phase. Although late-stage AD/dementia may be robustly differentiated from cognitively normal individuals by means of a clinical evaluation, PET imaging, and established biofluid biomarkers, disease differentiation between cognitively normal and various subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains a challenging task. Differential biomarkers for early-stage AD diagnosis with accessible biofluid samples are urgently needed. Misfolded phosphorylated tau aggregates (p-tau) are present in multiple neurodegenerative diseases known as \"tauopathies\", with the most common being AD. P-tau181 is a well-established p-tau biomarker to differentiate AD dementia from non-AD pathology. However, it is unclear if p-tau181 is capable of diagnosing MCI, an early AD stage, from cognitively normal subjects, or if it can discriminate MCI subtypes amnestic MCI (aMCI) from non-amnestic MCI (naMCI). Here we evaluated the capability of p-tau181 in diagnosing MCI from cognitively normal subjects and discriminating aMCI from naMCI subtypes. We collected matching plasma and CSF samples of a clinically diagnosed cohort of 35 cognitively normal, 34 aMCI, 17 naMCI, and 31 AD dementia cases (total 117 participants) with supplemental CSF A\u03b242 and total tau AD biomarker levels and performed Simoa p-tau181 assays. The diagnostic capabilities of Simoa p-tau181 assays to differentiate these cohorts were evaluated. We found (i) p-tau181 can robustly differentiate MCI or aMCI from cognitively normal cohorts with matching plasma and CSF samples, but such differentiation is weaker in diagnosing naMCI from cognitively normal groups, (ii) p-tau181 is not capable of differentiating aMCI from naMCI cohorts, and (iii) either factor of A\u03b2 or total tau burden markedly improved differentiation power to diagnose aMCI from cognitively normal group. Plasma and CSF p-tau181 levels may serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosing aMCI from normal controls in the preclinical phase. But more robust new biomarkers are needed to differentiate naMCI from cognitively normal cases or to discriminate between MCI subtypes, aMCI from naMCI.",

On the other hand, Artificial intelligence (AI) helps genome editing achieve more precision, efficiency, and affordability in tackling various diseases, like Sickle cell anemia or Thalassemia. AI models have been in use for designing guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas systems. Tools like DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and DeepHF have the capability to predict optimal guide RNAs (gRNAs) for a specified target sequence. These predictions take into account multiple factors, including genomic context, Cas protein type, desired mutation type, on-target/off-target scores, potential off-target sites, and the potential impacts of genome editing on gene function and cell phenotype. These models aid in optimizing different genome editing technologies, such as base, prime, and epigenome editing, which are advanced techniques to introduce precise and programmable changes to DNA sequences without relying on the homology-directed repair pathway or donor DNA templates. Furthermore, AI, in collaboration with genome editing and precision medicine, enables personalized treatments based on genetic profiles. AI analyzes patients' genomic data to identify mutations, variations, and biomarkers associated with different diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc. However, several challenges persist, including high costs, off-target editing, suitable delivery methods for CRISPR cargoes, improving editing efficiency, and ensuring safety in clinical applications. This review explores AI's contribution to improving CRISPR-based genome editing technologies and addresses existing challenges.

        "AbstractText": "Lysosomes primarily recognized as center for cellular 'garbage-disposing-unit', which has recently emerged as a crucial regulator of cellular metabolism. This organelle is a well-known vital player in the pathology including neurodegenerative disorders. In pathological context, removal of intracellular damaged misfolded proteins, organelles and aggregates are ensured by 'Autophagy' pathway, which initially recognizes, engulfs and seals the toxic cargo at the cytosolic environment. Thereafter the cell completes the task of encapsulated cargo elimination upon delivery of them to the terminal compartment - lysosome, which contains acid hydrolases, that are capable of degrading the abnormal protein-lipid-repertoire. The merge between inseparable 'Autophagy' and 'Lysosomal' pathways evolved into 'Autophagy-Lysosome Pathway (ALP)', through which cell ultimately degrades and recycles bio-materials for metabolic needs. Dysregulation of any of the steps of the multi-step ALP can contribute to the development and progression of disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Therefore, targeting differential steps of ALP or directly lysosomes using nano-bioengineering approaches holds great promise for therapeutic interventions. This review aims to explore the role of distal autophagy pathway and proximal lysosomal function, as cellular degradative and metabolic hubs, in healing neurological disorders and highlights the contributions of nano-bioengineering in this field. Despite multiple challenges, this review underscores the immense potential of integrating autophagy-lysosomal biology with nano-bioengineering to revolutionize the field and provide novel therapeutic avenues for tackling neurological-neurodegenerative-disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "The high prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is an unintended consequence of the high longevity of the population, together with the lack of effective preventive and therapeutic options. There is great pressure on preclinical research, and both old and new models of neurodegenerative diseases are required to increase the pipeline of new drugs for clinical testing. We review here the main models of neurotoxicity-based animal models leading to central neurodegeneration. Our main focus was on studying how changes in neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, mainly in rodent models, contribute to harmful processes linked to neurodegeneration. The majority of the models currently in use mimic Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are the most common neurodegenerative conditions in older adults. AD is the most common age-related dementia, whereas PD is the most common movement disorder with also cases of dementia. Several natural toxins and xenobiotic agents induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration and can reproduce neuropathological traits of PD. The literature analysis of MPTP, 6-OH-dopamine, and rotenone models suggested the latter as a useful model when specific doses of rotenone were administrated systemically to C57BL/6 mice. Cholinergic neurodegeneration is mainly modelled with the toxin scopolamine, which is a useful rodent model for the screening of protective drugs against cognitive decline and AD. Several agents have been used to model neuroinflammation-based neurodegeneration and dementia in AD, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), streptozotocin, and monomeric C-reactive protein. The bacterial agent LPS makes a useful rodent model for testing anti-inflammatory therapies to halt the development and severity of AD. However, neurotoxin models might be more useful than genetic models for drug discovery in PD but that is not the case in AD where they cannot beat the new developments in transgenic mouse models. Overall, we should work using all available models, either in vivo, in vitro, or in silico, considering the seriousness of the moment and urgency of developing effective drugs.",

This study evaluated early hippocampal oxidative stress, pre- and post-synaptic proteins in intraperitoneal (IP) and intracerebroventricular (ICV) streptozotocin (STZ) models of impaired insulin signaling. Adult male Wistar rats were injected with STZ, IP, or ICV, and sacrificed 1-, 3-, or 6-weeks post injection. Rat's cognitive behavior was assessed using Morris water maze (MWM) tests at weeks 3 and 6. Hippocampal synaptosomal fractions were examined for oxidative stress markers and presynaptic [synapsin I, synaptophysin, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), synaptosomal-associated protein-25 (SNAP-25)] and postsynaptic [drebrin, synapse-associated protein-97 (SAP-97), postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95)] proteins. IP-STZ and ICV-STZ treatment impaired rat's cognition, decreased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and increased the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) in a time dependent manner. In addition, it reduced the expression of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. The decline in cognition is significantly correlated with the reduction in synaptic proteins in the hippocampus. In conclusion, impaired insulin signaling in the brain is deleterious in causing early synaptosomal oxidative damage and synaptic loss that exacerbates with time and correlates with cognitive impairments. Our data implicates oxidative stress and synaptic protein loss as an early feature of sAD and provides insights into early biochemical and behavioral changes during disease progression.",

In this study, a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) model was utilized to capture differences in neurocognitive, genetic, and brain atrophy patterns that can predict cognitive status, ranging from Normal Cognition (NC) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Elucidating model predictions is vital in medical applications to promote clinical adoption and establish physician trust. Therefore, we introduce a decomposition-based explanation method for individual patient classification. Our method involves analyzing the output variations resulting from decomposing input values, which allows us to determine the degree of impact on the prediction. Through this process, we gain insight into how each feature from various modalities, both at the individual and group levels, contributes to the diagnostic result. Given that graph data contains critical information in edges, we studied relational data by silencing all the edges of a particular class, thereby obtaining explanations at the neighborhood level. Our functional evaluation showed that the explanations remain stable with minor changes in input values, specifically for edge weights exceeding 0.80. Additionally, our comparative analysis against SHAP values yielded comparable results with significantly reduced computational time. To further validate the model's explanations, we conducted a survey study with 11 domain experts. The majority (71%) of the responses confirmed the correctness of the explanations, with a rating of above six on a 10-point scale for the understandability of the explanations. Strategies to overcome perceived limitations, such as the GCN's overreliance on demographic information, were discussed to facilitate future adoption into clinical practice and gain clinicians' trust as a diagnostic decision support system.",

He subsequently developed incomplete palpebral ptosis, apparent dropped head, and shuffling of gait. The results of neostigmine tests were positive. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) showed significant decremental responses at 3 and 5 Hz in the orbicularis oculi.

One presented with classic anosognosia for memory impairment, while the other initially reported no memory impairment but later admitted to \"denying\" her memory difficulties secondary to anxiety.

We developed and validated a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based biological brain age prediction model that uses one T1w MRI preprocessing step when applying the model to external datasets to simplify implementation and increase accessibility in research settings. Our model only requires rigid image registration to the MNI space, which is an advantage compared to previous methods that require more preprocessing steps, such as feature extraction. We used a multicohort dataset of cognitively healthy individuals (age range\u2009=\u200932.0-95.7\u2009years) comprising 17,296 MRIs for training and evaluation. We compared our model using hold-out (CNN1) and cross-validation (CNN2-4) approaches. To verify generalisability, we used two external datasets with different populations and MRI scan characteristics to evaluate the model. To demonstrate its usability, we included the external dataset's images in the cross-validation training (CNN3). To ensure that our model used only the brain signal on the image, we also predicted brain age using skull-stripped images (CNN4). The trained models achieved a mean absolute error of 2.99, 2.67, 2.67, and 3.08\u2009years for CNN1-4, respectively. The model's performance in the external dataset was in the typical range of mean absolute error (MAE) found in the literature for testing sets. Adding the external dataset to the training set (CNN3), overall, MAE is unaffected, but individual cohort MAE improves (5.63-2.25\u2009years). Salience maps of predictions reveal that periventricular, temporal, and insular regions are the most important for age prediction. We provide indicators for using biological (predicted) brain age as a metric for age correction in neuroimaging studies as an alternative to the traditional chronological age. In conclusion, using different approaches, our CNN-based model showed good performance using one T1w brain MRI preprocessing step.

        "AbstractText": "The evaluation of pupillary light reflex (PLR) by chromatic pupillometry may provide a unique insight into specific photoreceptor functions. Chromatic pupillometry refers to evaluating PLR to different wavelengths and intensities of light in order to differentiate outer/inner retinal photoreceptor contributions to the PLR. Different protocols have been tested and are now established to assess in-vivo PLR contribution mediated by melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs). These intrinsically photosensitive photoreceptors modulate the non-image-forming functions of the eye, which are mainly the circadian photoentrainment and PLR, via projections to the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic and olivary pretectal nucleus, respectively. In this context, chromatic pupillometry has been used as an alternative and non-invasive tool to evaluate the mRGC system in several clinical settings, including hereditary optic neuropathies, glaucoma, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this article is to review the key steps of chromatic pupillometry protocols for studying in-vivo mRGC-system functionality and provide the main findings of this technique in the research setting on neurodegeneration. mRGC-dependent pupillary responses are short-wavelength sensitive, have a higher threshold of activation, and are much slower and sustained compared with rod- and cone-mediated responses, driving the tonic component of the PLR during exposure to high-irradiance and continuous light stimulus. Thus, mRGCs contribute mainly to the tonic component of the post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) to bright blue light flash that persists after light stimulation is switched off. Given the role of mRGCs in circadian photoentrainment, the use of chromatic pupillometry to perform a functional evaluation of mRGcs may be proposed as an early biomarker of mRGC-dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders characterized by circadian and/or sleep dysfunction such as AD, PD, and its prodromal phase iRBD. The evaluation by chromatic pupillometry of mRGC-system functionality may lay the groundwork for a new, easily accessible biomarker that can be exploited also as the starting point for future longitudinal cohort studies aimed at stratifying the risk of conversion in these disorders.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Immunological dimensions of neuroinflammation and microglial activation: exploring innovative immunomodulatory approaches to mitigate neuroinflammatory progression.",
        "AbstractText": "The increasing life expectancy has led to a higher incidence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions. Within this framework, neuroinflammation emerges as a significant contributing factor. It involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). These instances result in neuronal damage and neurodegeneration through activated nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathways and decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activity. Due to limited effectiveness regarding the inhibition of neuroinflammatory targets using conventional drugs, there is challenging growth in the search for innovative therapies for alleviating neuroinflammation in CNS diseases or even before their onset. Our results indicate that interventions focusing on Interleukin-Driven Immunomodulation, Chemokine (CXC) Receptor Signaling and Expression, Cold Exposure, and Fibrin-Targeted strategies significantly promise to mitigate neuroinflammatory processes. These approaches demonstrate potential anti-neuroinflammatory effects, addressing conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease. While the findings are promising, immunomodulatory therapies often face limitations due to Immune-Related Adverse Events. Therefore, the conduction of randomized clinical trials in this matter is mandatory, and will pave the way for a promising future in the development of new medicines with specific therapeutic targets.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuroinflammation has been identified as another significant pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease following A\u03b2 amyloid deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, activated in the central nervous system by glial cells in response to injury-related and pathogen-related molecular patterns. Moderate glial cell activity can be neuroprotective; however, excessive glial cell activation advances the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and is accompanied by structural changes in the brain interface, with peripheral immune cells entering the brain through the blood-brain barrier, creating a vicious circle. The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are primarily conveyed through extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSC-EVs participate in chronic inflammatory and immune processes by transferring nucleic acids, proteins and lipids from the parent cell to the recipient cell, thus MSC-EVs retain their immunomodulatory capacity while avoiding the safety issues associated with living cell therapy, making them a promising focus for immunomodulatory therapy. In this review, we discuss the modulatory effects of MSC-EVs on Alzheimer's disease-associated immune cells and the mechanisms involved in their treatment of the condition. We have found a clinical trial of MSC-EVs in Alzheimer's disease treatment and outlined the challenges of this approach. Overall, MSC-EVs have the potential to provide a safe and effective treatment option for Alzheimer's disease by targeting neuroinflammation.",

The development of sleep disorders is widespread in patients diagnosed with AD or PD. In this regard, calcification of the pineal gland, typically seen in the third decade, has been associated with a reduction in melatonin production. Recent studies have suggested that exogenous melatonin application can be utilized to treat sleep disorders in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, research has shown that deficiencies in melatonin levels in patients with AD or PD begin before a diagnosis of either\u00a0disease is made. These findings could encourage further research on melatonin as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis or a possible area for the early treatment of these diseases. Many clinical studies have also produced data denoting melatonin treatment as a method to reduce the detrimental neurocognitive effects of these diseases. Further research on the role of melatonin in neurodegenerative diseases could expand symptomatic and prophylactic treatment options for diseases such as AD and PD.

        "AbstractText": "Background: Recently, multiple preclinical studies have reported the beneficial effect of berberine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the neuroprotective effects and possible mechanisms of berberine against AD are not universally recognized. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis by integrating relevant animal studies to assess the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of berberine on AD. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases that reported the effects of berberine on AD models up to 1 February 2023. The escape latency, times of crossing platform, time spent in the target quadrant and pro-oligomerized amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b21-42) were included as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes were the Tau-ps 204, Tau-ps 404, \u03b2-site of APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), acetylcholine esterase (AChE), tumor necrosis factor \u237a (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Beclin-1 and neuronal apoptosis cells. This meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4 and STATA 15.1. The SYRCLE's risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality. Results: Twenty-two studies and 453 animals were included in the analysis. The overall results showed that berberine significantly shortened the escape latency (p < 0.00001), increased times of crossing platform (p < 0.00001) and time spent in the target quadrant (p < 0.00001), decreased A\u03b21-42 deposition (p < 0.00001), Tau-ps 202 (p < 0.00001) and Tau-ps 404 (p = 0.002), and improved BACE1, APP, AChE, Beclin-1, neuronal apoptosis cells, oxidative stress and inflammation levels. Conclusion: Berberine may be a promising drug for the treatment of AD based on preclinical evidence (especially when the dose was 5-260\u00a0mg/kg). The potential mechanisms for these protective effects may be closely related to anti-neuroinflammation, anti-oxidative stress, modulation of autophagy, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and protection of cholinergic system. However, these results may be limited by the quality of existing research. Larger and methodologically more rigorous preclinical research are needed to provide more convincing evidence.",

To date, the relationship between antidepressants and AD remains unclear. Methods: In our study, we administered sertraline or paroxetine to wild type (WT) and APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PSEN1) transgenic mouse models for up to 12\u00a0months. We quantified the drug concentrations using LC-MS/MS analysis and measured serum serotonin level using an ELISA assay. Additionally, we evaluated the amyloid burdens through thioflavin-S and Congo red stainings, and recognition memory using the novel object recognition test. Results: Our findings revealed that mice treated with paroxetine exhibited a significantly higher level of weight gain compared to the control group and increased mortality in APP/PSEN1 mice. After 12\u00a0months of antidepressant treatment, the sertraline level was measured at 289.8\u00a0ng/g for cerebellum, while the paroxetine level was 792.9\u00a0ng/g for cerebellum. Sertraline significantly increased thioflavin-S and Congo red depositions, along with gliosis, in both isocortex and hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 mice compared to the control group.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative condition, is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive functions. Current treatment approaches primarily involve the administration of medications through oral, parenteral, and transdermal routes, aiming to improve cognitive function and alleviate symptoms. However, these treatments face limitations, such as low bioavailability and inadequate permeation. Alternative invasive methods, while explored, often entail discomfort and require specialized assistance. Therefore, the development of a non-invasive and efficient delivery system is crucial. Intranasal delivery has emerged as a potential solution, although it is constrained by the unique conditions of the nasal cavity. An innovative approach involves the use of nano-carriers based on nanotechnology for intranasal delivery. This strategy has the potential to overcome current limitations by providing enhanced bioavailability, improved permeation, effective traversal of the blood-brain barrier, extended retention within the body, and precise targeting of the brain. The comprehensive review focuses on the advancements in designing various types of nano-carriers, including polymeric nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles, lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, Quantum dots, and dendrimers. These nano-carriers are specifically tailored for the intranasal delivery of therapeutic agents aimed at combatting Alzheimer's disease. In summary, the development and utilization of intranasal delivery systems based on nanotechnology show significant potential in surmounting the constraints of current Alzheimer's disease treatment strategies. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge regulatory as well as toxicity concerns associated with this route; meticulous consideration is required when engineering a carrier. This comprehensive review underscores the potential to revolutionize Alzheimer's disease management and highlights the importance of addressing regulatory considerations for safe and effective implementations.

Older people with HIV (PWH) are also at risk for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and Tau biomarkers are associated with aMCI/AD, but their relationship to HAND is unclear. Given the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in age-related neurological disorders, we investigated soluble and EV-associated A\u03b242, total Tau, NFL, GFAP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in relation to cognitive impairment in PWH. Plasma and CSF EVs were isolated from 184 participants (98 PWH on ART and 86 HIV- controls). Biomarkers were measured using Meso Scale Discovery assays. The median age of PWH was 53 years, and 52% were diagnosed with mild forms of HAND. PWH had increased plasma NFL (p = 0.04) and CSF A\u03b242 (p = 0.0003) compared with HIV- controls but no significant difference in Tau or EV-associated forms of these markers. CSF EV A\u03b242 was decreased (p = 0.0002) and CSF EV Tau/A\u03b242 ratio was increased (p = 0.001) in PWH with HAND vs. no HAND, while soluble forms of these markers showed no significant differences. Decreased CSF EV A\u03b242 (p < 0.0001) and an increased CSF EV Tau/A\u03b242 ratio (p = 0.0003) were associated with lower neurocognitive T scores in age-adjusted models; an optimal model included both CSF EV A\u03b242 and plasma NFL. Levels of soluble, but not EV-associated, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP were increased in PWH with HAND vs. no HAND (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that decreased A\u03b242 and an increased Tau/A\u03b242 ratio in CSF EVs are associated with cognitive impairment in older PWH, and these EV-associated biomarkers may help to distinguish aMCI/AD from HIV-related cognitive disorders in future studies.",

ADT has potential physiological effects such as a reduction in white matter integrity and a negative impact on hypothalamic functions due to the lowering of testosterone levels or the blockade of downstream androgen receptor signaling by first- and second-generation anti-androgen drugs. A comparative analysis of prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and Alzheimer patients identified over 30 shared genes, illustrating common ground for the mechanistic underpinning of the symptomatology. The purpose of this review was to investigate the effects of ADT on cognitive function, mood, and quality of life, as well as to analyze the relationship between ADT and Alzheimer's disease.

Based on the view that intermittent stress would be the most probable etiology for FM, intermittent cold- and intermittent psychological stress-induced generalized pain (ICGP and IPGP) models in mice have been developed and validated as FM-like pain models in terms of the patho-physiological and pharmacotherapeutic features that are shared with clinical versions. Both models show long-lasting and generalized pain and female-predominant sex differences after gonadectomy. Like many other neuropathic pain models, ICGP and IPGP were abolished in lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) knock-out mice or by LPAR1 antagonist treatments, although deciding the clinical importance of this mechanism depends on waiting for the development of a clinically available LPAR1 antagonist. On the other hand, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac with morphine did not suppress hyperalgesia in these models, and this is consistent with the clinical findings. Pharmacological studies suggest that the lack of morphine analgesia is associated with opioid tolerance upon the stress-induced release of endorphins and subsequent counterbalance through anti-opioid NMDA receptor mechanisms. Regarding pharmacotherapy, hyperalgesia in both models was suppressed by pregabalin and duloxetine, which have been approved for FM treatment in clinic. Notably, repeated treatments with mirtazapine, an \u03b12 adrenergic receptor antagonist-type antidepressant, and donepezil, a drug for treating Alzheimer's disease, showed potent therapeutic actions in these models. However, the pharmacotherapeutic treatment should be carried out 3 months after stress, which is stated in the FM guideline, and many preclinical studies, such as those analyzing molecular and cellular mechanisms, as well as additional evidence using different animal models, are required. Thus, the ICGP and IPGP models have the potential to help discover and characterize new therapeutic medicines that might be used for the radical treatment of FM, although there are several limitations to be overcome.",

The path MCI takes can be divergent; while some maintain stability or even revert to cognitive norms, alarmingly, up to half of the cases progress to dementia within 5 years. Current diagnostic practice lacks the necessary screening tools to identify those at risk of progression. The European patient experience often involves a long journey from the initial signs of MCI to the eventual diagnosis of dementia. The trajectory is far from ideal. Here, we introduce the AI-Mind project, a pioneering initiative with an innovative approach to early risk assessment through the implementation of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) on multimodal data. The cutting-edge AI-based tools developed in the project aim not only to accelerate the diagnostic process but also to deliver highly accurate predictions regarding an individual's risk of developing dementia when prevention and intervention may still be possible.

On the other hand, Alzheimer's disease may slightly increase the incidence of colorectal cancer, with an OR of 1.014 (95% CI: 1.001-1.027). However, the results of one subgroup were not significant, and the results from MRlap indicated that sample overlap introduced bias into the results. Therefore, the results of the reverse validation are not reliable. The F-statistic for all SNPs was greater than 20. Four SNPs related to the outcome were excluded using Phenoscanner website but the adjustment did not affect the overall direction of the results. The results of these statistics were further validated by MR-PRESSO, funnel plots, leave-one-out analyses, Cochran's Q, demonstrating the reliability of the findings. Conclusion: According to the findings of this Mendelian randomization study, there appears to be a causal association between colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease. These results could have important implications for clinical practice in terms of how colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease are treated. To better understand the relationship between these two diseases, more research and screening are needed in clinical settings.",

Studies indicate that cognitive reserve theory could be beneficial in this regard. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between lifestyle socio-behavioral proxies of cognitive reserve and cortical regions in adults with no subjective cognitive decline. Overall, 58 participants, aged 65-85\u2009years, were included in the data analysis (M\u2009=\u200971.83, SD\u2009=\u20095.02, 20.7% male). Cognitive reserve proxies were measured using the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire, while cortical volumes were obtained with the Siemens 1.5\u2009T Avanto MRI scanner and further mapped using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) Atlas. Estimated intracranial volume and age were used as covariates. The results indicated that higher occupational complexity was associated with larger cortical volume in the left middle temporal gyrus, the left and right inferior temporal gyrus, and the left inferior parietal lobule, while a combined proxy (the total CRI score) showed a positive relationship with the volume of left middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, and pars orbitalis in the right hemisphere. These results might indicate that more complex occupational activities and overall more intellectually and socially active life-style could contribute to better brain health, especially in regions known to be more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides new perspectives and ideas to investigate the interactions between different cell types and organisms. By integrating scRNA-seq with new computational frameworks or specific technologies, better Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments may be developed. The single-cell sequencing dataset GSE158234 was obtained from the GEO database. Preprocessing, quality control, dimensionality-reducing clustering, and annotation to identify cell types were performed on it. RNA-seq profiling dataset GSE238013 was used to determine the components of specific cell subpopulations in diverse samples. A set of genes included in the OMIM, Genecards, CTD, and DisGeNET databases were selected as highly plausible AD-related genes. Then, ROC curves were created to predict the diagnostic value using the significantly expressed genes in the KO group as hub genes. The genes mentioned above were mapped to the Coremine Medical database to forecast prospective therapeutic Chinese medicines, and a \"Chinese medicine-ingredient-target\" network was constructed to screen for potential therapeutic targets. The last step was to undertake Mendelian randomization research to determine the causal link between the critical gene IL1B and AD in the genome-wide association study. Using the scRNA-seq dataset, five unique cell clusters were discovered. These clusters were further subdivided into four distinct cell types using marker genes. The KO group showed a more substantial differential subgroup of macrophages than the WT group. By using the available datasets and PPI network analysis, 54 common genes were discovered. Four clusters were identified using the MCODE approach, and correlation analysis showed that seven genes in those four clusters had a significantly negative correlation with macrophages. Six genes in four sets had a significantly positive correlation. Five genes had different levels of expression in the WT and KO groups. The String database was used to identify the regulatory relationships between the four genes (IL10, CX3CR1, IL1B, and IL6) that were finally selected as AD hub genes. Screening identified potential traditional Chinese medicine to intervene in the transformation process of AD, including Radix Salviae, ginseng, Ganoderma, licorice, Coptidis Rhizoma, and Scutellariae Radix, in addition to promising therapeutic targets, such as PTGS1, PTGS2, and RXRA. Finally, it was shown that IL1B directly correlated with immune cell infiltration in AD. In inverse variance weighting, we found that IL1B was associated with a higher risk of AD, with an OR of 1.003 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.001-1.006, p\u2009=\u20090.038). Our research combined network pharmacology and the scRNA-seq computational framework to uncover pertinent hub genes and prospective traditional Chinese medicine potential therapeutic targets for AD. These discoveries may aid in understanding the molecular processes behind AD genes and the development of novel medications to treat the condition.",

        "AbstractText": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and epilepsy share proposed mechanisms of injury, including neuronal excitotoxicity, cascade signaling, and activation of protein biomarkers such as tau. Although tau is typically present intracellularly, in tauopathies, phosphorylated (p-) and hyper-phosphorylated (hp-) tau are released extracellularly, the latter leading to decreased neuronal stability and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Tau cleavage at particular sites increases susceptibility to hyper-phosphorylation, NFT formation, and eventual cell death. The relationship between tau and inflammation, however, is unknown. In this review, we present evidence for an imbalanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and inflammatory signaling pathways resulting in atypical p-tau, hp-tau and NFT formation. Further, we propose tau as a biomarker for neuronal injury severity in TBI, AD, and epilepsy. We present a hypothesis of tau phosphorylation as an initial acute neuroprotective response to seizures/TBI. However, if the underlying seizure pathology or TBI recurrence is not effectively treated, and the pathway becomes chronically activated, we propose a \"tipping point\" hypothesis that identifies a transition of tau phosphorylation from neuroprotective to injurious. We outline the role of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) as a \"last ditch effort\" to revert the cell to programmed death signaling, that, when fails, transitions the mechanism from injurious to neurodegenerative. Lastly, we discuss targets along these pathways for therapeutic intervention in AD, TBI, and epilepsy.",

Among the environmental factors, the role of the microbiome in the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) is gaining increased recognition. This paradigm shift is substantiated by an extensive body of scientific literature, which underscores the significant contributions of microorganisms, encompassing viruses and gut-derived bacteria, to the pathogenesis of AD. The mechanism by which microbial infection exerts its influence on AD hinges primarily on inflammation. Neuroinflammation, activated in response to microbial infections, acts as a defense mechanism for the brain but can inadvertently lead to unexpected neuropathological perturbations, ultimately contributing to NDs. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the genetic factors underpinning ND, comprehensive investigations into environmental factors, particularly the microbiome and viral agents, are imperative. Recent advances in neuroscientific research have unveiled the pivotal role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in orchestrating various pathways integral to neurodegenerative pathologies. While the upstream regulators governing the pathological manifestations of microorganisms remain elusive, an in-depth exploration of the nuanced role of ncRNAs holds promise for the development of prospective therapeutic interventions.

A greater understanding of the mechanisms for glymphatic transport may provide insight into how amyloid beta (A\u03b2) and tau agglomerates, key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, accumulate and drive disease progression. In this study, we develop an image-guided computational model to describe glymphatic transport and A\u03b2 deposition throughout the brain. A\u03b2 transport and deposition are modeled using an advection-diffusion equation coupled with an irreversible amyloid accumulation (damage) model. We use immersed isogeometric analysis, stabilized using the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, where the transport model is constructed using parameters inferred from brain imaging data resulting in a subject-specific model that accounts for anatomical geometry and heterogeneous material properties. Both short-term (30-min) and long-term (12-month) 3D simulations of soluble amyloid transport within a mouse brain model were constructed from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) data. In addition to matching short-term patterns of tracer deposition, we found that transport parameters such as CSF flow velocity play a large role in amyloid plaque deposition. The computational tools developed in this work will facilitate investigation of various hypotheses related to glymphatic transport and fundamentally advance our understanding of its role in neurodegeneration, which is crucial for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "Given the remarkable progress in global health and overall quality of life, the significant rise in life expectancy has become intertwined with the surging occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). This emerging trend is poised to pose a substantial challenge to the fields of medicine and public health in the years ahead. In this context, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as an ND that causes recent memory loss, motor impairment and cognitive deficits. AD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and its development is linked to multifactorial interactions between the environment, genetics, aging and lifestyle. The pathological hallmarks in AD are the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2), the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, neurotoxic events and impaired glucose metabolism. Due to pharmacological limitations and in view of the prevailing glycemic hypometabolism, the ketogenic diet (KD) emerges as a promising non-pharmacological possibility for managing AD, an approach that has already demonstrated efficacy in addressing other disorders, notably epilepsy. The KD consists of a food regimen in which carbohydrate intake is discouraged at the expense of increased lipid consumption, inducing metabolic ketosis whereby the main source of energy becomes ketone bodies instead of glucose. Thus, under these dietary conditions, neuronal death via lack of energy would be decreased, inasmuch as the metabolism of lipids is not impaired in AD. In this way, the clinical picture of patients with AD would potentially improve via the slowing down of symptoms and delaying of the progression of the disease. Hence, this review aims to explore the rationale behind utilizing the KD in AD treatment while emphasizing the metabolic interplay between the KD and the improvement of AD indicators, drawing insights from both preclinical and clinical investigations. Via a comprehensive examination of the studies detailed in this review, it is evident that the KD emerges as a promising alternative for managing AD. Moreover, its efficacy is notably enhanced when dietary composition is modified, thereby opening up innovative avenues for decreasing the progression of AD.",

Symptoms observed in patients with AD include struggles with writing, speech, memory, and knowledge.

The emotional and cognitive centers in the brain are linked to the functions of the peripheral intestinal system via this gut-brain axis. Dysbiosis has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, indicating the significance of gut homeostasis for proper brain function. Probiotics play an important role in protecting against the symptoms of AD as they restore gut-brain homeostasis to a great extent.

This complexity is reflected by the equally complex diversity of risk factors associated with AD. However, more than merely mirroring disease complexity, risk factors also provide fundamental insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD as a neurodegenerative disorder since they are central to disease initiation and subsequent propagation. Based on a systematic literature assessment, this review identified 30 risk factors for AD and then extended the analysis to further identify neuroinflammation as a unifying mechanism present in all 30 risk factors. Although other mechanisms (e.g., vasculopathy, proteopathy) were present in multiple risk factors, dysfunction of the neuroimmune-neuroinflammation axis was uniquely central to all 30 identified risk factors. Though the nature of the neuroinflammatory involvement varied, the activation of microglia and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines were a common pathway shared by all risk factors. This observation provides further evidence for the importance of immunopathic mechanisms in the aetiopathogenesis of AD.",

They are often referred to as polyphenols and are known, among others, for their pharmacological effects supporting health through the inhibition of aging processes and oxidative stress. To improve their bioavailability, pharmacological activities, and safety, the creation of novel flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids is an area of active research. Previous work showed that such hybridization products of phenolic acids and flavonoids enhanced the resilience of neuronal cells against oxidative stress in vitro, and attenuated cognitive impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. Notably, the therapeutic effects of the hybrid compounds we obtained were more pronounced than the protective activities of the respective individual components. The underlying mechanisms mediated by the flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids, however, remained unclear and may differ from the signaling pathways activated by the originating structures of the respective individual phenolic acids or flavonoids. In this study, we characterized the effects of four previously described potent flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids in models of oxidative cell death through ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial ROS generation and has been linked to neurodegenerative conditions. In models of ferroptosis induced by erastin or RSL3, we analyzed mitochondrial (lipid) peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane integrity, and Ca2+ regulation. Our results demonstrate the strong protective effects of the hybrid compounds against ROS formation in the cytosol and mitochondria. Importantly, these protective effects against ferroptosis were not mediated by radical scavenging activities of the phenolic hybrid compounds but through inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity and reduced mitochondrial respiration. Our data highlight the effects of flavonoid-phenolic acid hybrids on mitochondrial metabolism and further important mitochondrial parameters that collectively determine the health and functionality of mitochondria with a high impact on the integrity and survival of the neuronal cells.",

The association between years of education, a proxy of cognitive reserve, and resting-state functional connectivity (rFC), a representative intermediate phenotype, has not been explored in the preclinical phase, considering risk factors for AD. We aimed to evaluate whether the relationship between years of education and rFC in cognitively preserved older adults differs depending on amyloid-beta deposition and APOE \u03b54 carrier status as effect modifiers. : A total of 121 participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, [18F] flutemetamol positron emission tomography-computed tomography, APOE genotyping, and a neuropsychological battery. Potential interactions between years of education and AD risk factors for rFC of AD-vulnerable neural networks were assessed with whole-brain voxel-wise analysis. : We found a significant education years-by-APOE \u03b54 carrier status interaction for the rFC from the seed region of the central executive (CEN) and dorsal attention networks. Moreover, there was a significant interaction of rFC between right superior occipital gyrus and the CEN seed region by APOE \u03b54 carrier status for memory performances and overall cognitive function. : In preclinical APOE \u03b54 carriers, higher years of education were associated with higher rFC of the AD vulnerable network, but this contributed to lower cognitive function. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the impact of cognitive reserve on sensitive functional intermediate phenotypic markers in the preclinical phase of AD.",

Previous quantitative HPLC profiling analysis has revealed the presence of Pinostrobin, formononetin, vitexin and other neuroprotective flavonoids in Cajanus cajan seed extract. This study was designed to investigate the protective action of Cajanus cajan ethanol seed extract (CC) on learning and memory functions using scopolamine mouse model of amnesia. Materials and methods: Adult mice were pretreated with CC (50, 100, or 200mg/kg, p.o) or vehicle (10ml/kg, p.o) for 16 days consecutively. Scopolamine, a competitive muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (1mg/kg, i.p.) was given an hour after CC pretreatment from days 3 to 16.\u00a0 The mice were subjected to behavioural tests from day 11 (open field test (OFT)/ Y-maze test (YMT) and Morris water maze task (MWM) from days 12-16. Animals were euthanized 1h after behavioral test on day 16 and discrete brain regions isolated for markers of oxidative stress and cholinergic signaling. Molecular docking analysis was undertaken to predict the possible mechanism(s) of CC-induced anti-amnesic action.\u00a0 pre-administration of CC significantly reversed working memory and learning deficits caused by scopolamine in YMT and MWM tests, respectively. Moreover, CC prevented scopolamine-induced oxidative and nitrosative stress radicals in the hippocampus evidenced in significant increase in glutathione (GSH) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities with a marked decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) production, as well as significant inhibition of hippocampal scopolamine-induced increase in acetylcholinesterase activity by CC. The molecular docking analysis showed that out of the 19 compounds, the following had the highest binding affinity; Pinostrobin (-8.7 Kcal/mol), friedeline (-7.5kCal/mol), and lupeol (-8.2 Kcal/mol), respectively, to neuronal muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptor, \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and amyloid beta peptide binding pockets, which further supports the ability of CC to enhance neuronal cholinergic signaling and possible inhibition of amyloid beta aggregation.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with the pathological hallmarks of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Although there is a hope that anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies may emerge as a new therapy for AD, the high cost and side effect is a big concern. Non-drug therapy is attracting more attention and may provide a better resolution for the treatment of AD. Given the fact that hypoxia contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) may be an effective intervention that can alleviate hypoxia and improve AD. However, it remains unclear whether long-term HBOT intervention in the early stage of AD can slow AD progression and ultimately prevent cognitive impairment in this disease. In this study we applied consecutive 3-month HBOT interventions on 3-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice which represent the early stage of AD. When the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice at 9-month-old which represent the disease stage we measured cognitive function, 24-h blood oxygen saturation, A\u03b2 and tau pathologies, vascular structure and function, and neuroinflammation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our results showed that long-term HBOT can attenuate the impairments in cognitive function observed in 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Most importantly, HBOT effectively reduced the progression of A\u03b2 plaques deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregation, and neuronal and synaptic degeneration in the AD mice. Further, long-term HBOT was able to enhance blood oxygen saturation level. Besides, long-term HBOT can improve vascular structure and function, and reduce neuroinflammation in AD mice. This study is the first to demonstrate that long-term HBOT intervention in the early stage of AD can attenuate cognitive impairment and AD-like pathologies. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of long-term HBOT as a disease-modifying approach for AD treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has a key function in maintaining homeostasis in the brain, partly modulated by transporters, which are highly expressed in brain endothelial cells (BECs). Transporters mediate the uptake or efflux of compounds to and from the brain and they can also challenge the delivery of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently there is a limited understanding of changes in BBB transporters in AD. To investigate this, we generated brain endothelial-like cells (iBECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with familial AD (FAD) Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutation and identified AD-specific differences in transporter expression compared to control (ctrl) iBECs. We first characterized the expression levels of 12 BBB transporters in AD-, Ctrl-, and isogenic (PSEN1 corrected) iBECs to identify any AD specific differences. We then exposed the cells to focused ultrasound (FUS) in the absence (FUSonly) or presence of microbubbles (MB) (FUS+MB), which is a novel therapeutic method that can be used to transiently open the BBB to increase drug delivery into the brain, however its effects on BBB transporter expression are largely unknown. Following FUSonly and FUS+MB, we investigated whether the expression or activity of key transporters could be modulated. Our findings demonstrate that PSEN1 mutant FAD (PSEN1AD) possess phenotypical differences compared to control iBECs in BBB transporter expression and function. Additionally, we show that FUSonly and FUS+MB can modulate BBB transporter expression and functional activity in iBECs, having potential implications on drug penetration and amyloid clearance. These findings highlight the differential responses of patient cells to FUS treatment, with patient-derived models likely providing an important tool for modelling therapeutic effects of FUS.",

Tau reduction prevents amyloid-\u03b2-induced dysfunction in preclinical models of AD and also prevents amyloid-\u03b2-independent dysfunction in diverse disease models, especially those with network hyperexcitability, suggesting that strategies exploiting the mechanisms underlying Tau reduction may extend beyond AD. Tau binds several SH3 domain-containing proteins implicated in AD via its central proline-rich domain. We previously used a peptide inhibitor to demonstrate that blocking Tau interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins ameliorates amyloid-\u03b2-induced dysfunction. Here, we identify a top hit from high-throughput screening for small molecules that inhibit Tau-FynSH3 interactions and describe its optimization with medicinal chemistry. The resulting lead compound is a potent cell-permeable Tau-SH3 interaction inhibitor that binds Tau and prevents amyloid-\u03b2-induced dysfunction, including network hyperexcitability.

Therefore, we created an arterially perfused in situ preparation that allowed us to investigate functional interactions in the CNS from the neonatal to adult period. Decerebrated rodents were kept alive via total artificial cardiopulmonary bypass for extracorporeal circulation; the plasma oxygen and ion components needed for survival were supplied through the blood vessels. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor that promotes myeloid cell development and stimulates innate immune responses. In the brain, IRF8 is expressed only in microglia and directs the expression of many genes that serve microglial functions. Recent evidence indicates that IRF8 affects behavior and modulates Alzheimer's disease progression in a mouse model. However, whether this immune deficiency arising from the absence of IRF8 influences the development of the neuronal network in the spinal cord is unknown. We applied the above methodology to mice of all ages and electrophysiologically explored whether the absence of IRF8 influences the development of lumbar central pattern generator (CPG) networks. In mice of all ages, bilateral neuronal discharges by the normal CPG networks activated by the modulated sympathetic tone via descending pathways at high flow rates became organized into discharge episodes punctuated by periods of quiescence. Similar discharge episodes were generated by the adult CPG networks (\u2265P14 days) activated by drug application. However, discharge episodes elicited by activating the neonatal-juvenile CPG networks (<P14 days) occurred alternately on the left and right sides. Interestingly, discharge episodes elicited by the CPG networks in adult IRF8 knockout mice (P11-12\u2009weeks) consisted of those elicited by the CPG networks of both periods. Thus, it was suggested that growing up with immunodeficiency due to loss of IRF8 might interfere with the normal development of functions exerted by the lumbar CPG network because IRF8 plays a role in the normal development of the lumbar CPG network.",

The aim of this literature review is to delve into scientific papers that are centered on modern laboratory tests for Alzheimers disease, including tests for biological markers at the early stages of cognitive impairment.

The most promising neurotrophic, neuroinflammatory, and genetic markers, including polygenic risk models, are also discussed. The use of biomarkers in clinical practice will contribute to the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimers disease. Genetic screening tests can improve the detection threshold of preclinical abnormalities in the absence of obvious symptoms of cognitive decline.

This study aimed to profile the plasma metabolome of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), two neurodegenerative disorders for which our understanding of the pathophysiology is incomplete. In the clinical setting, DLB is often mistaken for AD, highlighting a need for accurate diagnostic biomarkers. We therefore also aimed to determine the overlapping and differentiating metabolite patterns associated with each and establish whether identification of these patterns could be leveraged as biomarkers to support clinical diagnosis. A panel of 630 metabolites (Biocrates MxP Quant 500) and a further 232 metabolism indicators (biologically informative sums and ratios calculated from measured metabolites, each indicative for a specific pathway or synthesis; MetaboINDICATOR) were analyzed in plasma from patients with probable DLB (n\u2009=\u200915; age 77.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.2\u2009years), probable AD (n\u2009=\u200915; 76.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009years), and age-matched cognitively healthy controls (HC; n\u2009=\u200915; 75.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.9\u2009years). Metabolites were quantified using a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography column and triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, or by using flow injection analysis in MRM mode. Data underwent multivariate (PCA analysis), univariate and receiving operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Metabolite data were also correlated (Spearman r) with the collected clinical neuroimaging and protein biomarker data. The PCA plot separated DLB, AD and HC groups (R2\u2009=\u20090.518, Q2\u2009=\u20090.348). Significant alterations in 17 detected metabolite parameters were identified (q\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), including neurotransmitters, amino acids and glycerophospholipids. Glutamine (Glu; q\u2009=\u20090.045) concentrations and indicators of sphingomyelin hydroxylation (q\u2009=\u20090.039) distinguished AD and DLB, and these significantly correlated with semi-quantitative measurement of cardiac sympathetic denervation.

These consist of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Moreover, idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is often the first manifestation of synucleinopathies, demonstrating a pathophysiological continuum. While these disorders vary in prevalence, symptom patterns, and severity, they can all include autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction, which significantly reduces quality of life and worsens prognosis. Consequently, identifying abnormalities of the ANS can provide opportunities for improving quality of life through symptomatic treatments that are tailored to the individual's symptoms. An exciting development is using heart rate variability (HRV) as a non-invasive research tool for analyzing how the ANS regulates physiological processes. HRV during sleep, however, may provide a more accurate and reliable measure of ANS activity than during wakefulness, as during awake time, ANS activity is influenced by a variety of factors, including physical activity, stress, and emotions, which may mask or confound the underlying patterns of ANS activity. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding sleep-related HRV in synucleinopathies and to discuss contributing mechanisms. Evidence suggests that iRBD, PD, and MSA are associated with nocturnal ANS dysfunction. Further, comparative studies indicate that the presence of RBD could exacerbate this abnormality. In contrast, no studies have been conducted in patients with DLB. Overall, this review provides new insight into the complex interplay between the ANS and synucleinopathies and underscores the need for further research in this area to develop effective therapies to improve sleep and overall quality of life in patients with synucleinopathies.",

Just as with other cells, their proliferation and differentiation are modulated by various mechanisms. These mechanisms are foundational to the strategies developed to induce neuronal proliferation and differentiation, with potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative diseases. The most common among these diseases are Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, associated with the formation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregates which cause a reduction in the number of neurons.

Moreover, combinations of these compounds can potentially transform somatic cells into neurons. This transformation process involves the activation of neuron-specific transcription factors such as NEUROD1, NGN2, ASCL1, and SOX2, which subsequently leads to the transcription of downstream genes, culminating in the transformation of somatic cells into neurons. Neurodegenerative diseases are not the only conditions where inducing neuronal proliferation could be beneficial.

In the multivariable adjusted model, patients with PD in the highest quartile (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR]\u2009=\u20091.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.88), quartile 3 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.29, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.62), and quartile 2 (SHR\u2009=\u20091.30, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.63) were independently associated with a higher risk of PDD than those in the lowest quartile. We highlighted the effect of long-term glucose variability on the development of PDD in patients with PD. Furthermore, our findings suggest that preventive measures for constant glucose control may be necessary to prevent PDD.",

        "AbstractText": "Brain aging is a complex process influenced by various lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors, as well as by age-related and often co-existing pathologies. MRI and, more recently, AI methods have been instrumental in understanding the neuroanatomical changes that occur during aging in large and diverse populations. However, the multiplicity and mutual overlap of both pathologic processes and affected brain regions make it difficult to precisely characterize the underlying neurodegenerative profile of an individual from an MRI scan. Herein, we leverage a state-of-the art deep representation learning method, Surreal-GAN, and present both methodological advances and extensive experimental results that allow us to elucidate the heterogeneity of brain aging in a large and diverse cohort of 49,482 individuals from 11 studies. Five dominant patterns of neurodegeneration were identified and quantified for each individual by their respective (herein referred to as) R-indices. Significant associations between R-indices and distinct biomedical, lifestyle, and genetic factors provide insights into the etiology of observed variances. Furthermore, baseline R-indices showed predictive value for disease progression and mortality. These five R-indices contribute to MRI-based precision diagnostics, prognostication, and may inform stratification into clinical trials.",

        "AbstractText": "Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes, such as Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), have traditionally been diagnosed based in part on verbal and nonverbal cognitive profiles. Debate continues about whether PPA is best subdivided into three variants and also regarding the most distinctive linguistic features for classifying PPA variants. In this study, we harnessed the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to first perform unsupervised classification of concise, connected speech samples from 78 PPA patients. Large Language Models discerned three distinct PPA clusters, with 88.5% agreement with independent clinical diagnoses. Patterns of cortical atrophy of three data-driven clusters corresponded to the localization in the clinical diagnostic criteria. We then used NLP to identify linguistic features that best dissociate the three PPA variants. Seventeen features emerged as most valuable for this purpose, including the observation that separating verbs into high and low-frequency types significantly improves classification accuracy. Using these linguistic features derived from the analysis of brief connected speech samples, we developed a classifier that achieved 97.9% accuracy in predicting PPA subtypes and healthy controls. Our findings provide pivotal insights for refining early-stage dementia diagnosis, deepening our understanding of the characteristics of these neurodegenerative phenotypes and the neurobiology of language processing, and enhancing diagnostic evaluation accuracy.",

        "AbstractText": "Measurement error limits the statistical power to detect group differences and longitudinal change in structural MRI morphometric measures (e.g., hippocampal volume, prefrontal thickness). Recent advances in scan acceleration enable extremely fast T1-weighted scans (~1 minute) to achieve morphometric errors that are close to the errors in longer traditional scans. As acceleration allows multiple scans to be acquired in rapid succession, it becomes possible to pool estimates to increase measurement precision, a strategy known as \"cluster scanning.\" Here we explored brain morphometry using cluster scanning in a test-retest study of 40 individuals (12 younger adults, 18 cognitively unimpaired older adults, and 10 adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's Dementia). Morphometric errors from a single compressed sensing (CS) 1.0mm scan with 6x acceleration (CSx6) were, on average, 12% larger than a traditional scan using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocol. Pooled estimates from four clustered CSx6 acquisitions led to errors that were 34% smaller than ADNI despite having a shorter total acquisition time. Given a fixed amount of time, a gain in measurement precision can thus be achieved by acquiring multiple rapid scans instead of a single traditional scan. Errors were further reduced when estimates were pooled from eight CSx6 scans (51% smaller than ADNI). Neither pooling across a break nor pooling across multiple scan resolutions boosted this benefit. We discuss the potential of cluster scanning to improve morphometric precision, boost statistical power, and produce more sensitive disease progression biomarkers.",

        "AbstractText": "Nearly two-thirds of patients with Alzheimer's are women. Identifying therapeutics specific for women is critical to lowering their elevated risk for developing this major cause of adult dementia. Moreover, targeting epigenetic processes that regulate multiple cellular pathways is advantageous given Alzheimer's multifactorial nature. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic process heavily involved in memory consolidation. Its disruption is linked to Alzheimer's. Through our computational studies, we predicted that the investigational drug RG2833 (N-[6-(2-aminoanilino)-6-oxohexyl]-4-methylbenzamide) has repurposing potential for Alzheimer's. RG2833 is a histone deacetylase HDAC1/3 inhibitor that is orally bioavailable and permeates the blood-brain-barrier. We investigated the RG2833 therapeutic potential in TgF344-AD rats, which are a model of Alzheimer's that exhibits age-dependent progression, thus mimicking this aspect of Alzheimer's patients that is difficult to establish in animal models. We investigated the RG2833 effects on cognitive performance, gene expression, and AD-like pathology in 11-month TgF344-AD female and male rats. A total of 89 rats were used: wild type n = 45 (17 females, 28 males), and TgF344-AD n = 44 (24 females, 20 males)] across multiple cohorts. No obvious toxicity was detected in the TgF344-AD rats up to 6 months of RG2833-treatment starting at 5 months of age administering the drug in rodent chow at \u223c30mg/kg of body weight. We started treatment early in the course of pathology when therapeutic intervention is predicted to be more effective than in later stages of the disease. The drug-treatment significantly mitigated hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits in 11-month TgF344-AD females but not in males, compared to wild type littermates. This female sex-specific drug effect has not been previously reported. RG2833-treatment failed to ameliorate amyloid beta accumulation and microgliosis in female and male TgF344-AD rats. However, RNAseq analysis of hippocampal tissue from TgF344-AD rats showed that drug-treatment in females upregulated the expression of immediate early genes, such as Arc, Egr1 and c-Fos, and other genes involved in synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Remarkably, out of 17,168 genes analyzed for each sex, no significant changes in gene expression were detected in males at P < 0.05, false discovery rate < 0.05, and fold-change \u2265 1.5. Our data suggest that histone modifying therapeutics such as RG2833 improve cognitive behavior by modulating the expression of immediate early, neuroprotective and synaptic plasticity genes. Our preclinical study supports that RG2833 has therapeutic potential specifically for female Alzheimer's patients. RG2833 evaluations using other AD-related models is necessary to confirm our findings.",

These neuronal EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier and enter peripheral circulation, offering a less invasive means for assessing blood-based AD biomarkers. In this study, we analyzed plasma EV-derived messenger RNA (mRNA) from 82 subjects, including individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to profile their gene expression for functional enrichment and pathway analysis. Based on the differentially expressed genes identified in both MCI and AD groups, we established a diagnostic model by implementing a machine learning classifier. The refined model demonstrated an average diagnostic accuracy over 98% and showed a strong correlation with different AD stages, suggesting the potential of plasma EV-derived mRNA as a promising non-invasive biomarker for early detection and ongoing monitoring of AD.",

This study quantified brain amyloid burden with kinetic modeling, leveraging dynamic 18F-florbetaben PET in aorta IDIFs and the brain in an elderly cohort. 18F-florbetaben dynamic PET imaging was performed on the EXPLORER system with tracer injection (300 MBq) in 3 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 3 with mild cognitive impairment, and 9 healthy controls. Image-derived input functions were extracted from the descending aorta with manual regions of interest based on the first 30 seconds after injection. Dynamic time-activity curves (TACs) for 110 minutes were fitted to the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) using population-based metabolite corrected IDIFs to calculate total and specific distribution volumes (VT, Vs) in key brain regions with early amyloid accumulation. Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was also calculated from the multi-reference tissue model (MRTM). Amyloid-positive (AD) patients showed the highest VT and VS in anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus, consistent with BPND analysis. BPND and VT from kinetic models were correlated (r2 = 0.46, P<2e-16) with a stronger positive correlation observed in amyloid-positive participants, indicating reliable model fits with the IDIFs. VT from 2TCM was highly correlated (r2 = 0.65, P< 2e-16) with Logan graphical VT estimation. Non-invasive quantification of amyloid binding from total-body 18F-florbetaben PET data is feasible using aorta IDIFs with high agreement between kinetic distribution volume parameters compared to BPND in amyloid-positive and negative older individuals.",

There is evidence that typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol are more effective in reducing positive symptoms than negative symptoms and/or cognitive deficits. In contrast, atypical antipsychotic agents have gained popularity over typical antipsychotics, due to fewer extrapyramidal side effects and their theoretical efficacy in controlling both positive and negative symptoms. Although these therapies focus on neuron-based therapeutic schemes, glial cells have been recognized as important regulators of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as targets to improve the efficacy of these drugs. Glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) are critical for the central nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells and play important roles in brain homeostasis, regulating neurotransmitter systems and gliotransmission, since they express a wide variety of functional receptors for different neurotransmitters. In addition, converging lines of evidence indicate that psychiatric disorders are commonly associated with the triad neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity, and that glial cells may contribute to the gliotoxicity process. Conversely, glioprotective molecules attenuate glial damage by generating specific responses that can protect glial cells themselves and/or neurons, resulting in improved central nervous system (CNS) functioning. In this regard, resveratrol is well-recognized as a glioprotective molecule, including in clinical studies of schizophrenia and autism. This review will provide a summary of the dual role of antipsychotics on neurochemical parameters associated with glial functions and will highlight the potential activity of glioprotective molecules to improve the action of antipsychotics.",

However, some older adult people with AD pathological hallmarks can retain cognitive function. Unraveling the factors that lead to this cognitive resilience to AD offers promising prospects for identifying new therapeutic targets. Our hypothesis focuses on the contribution of resilience to changes in excitatory synapses at the structural and molecular levels, which may underlie healthy cognitive performance in aged AD animals. Utilizing the Morris Water Maze test, we selected resilient (asymptomatic) and cognitively impaired aged Tg2576 mice. While the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed similar levels of A\u03b242 in both experimental groups, western blot analysis revealed differences in tau pathology in the pre-synaptic supernatant fraction. To further investigate the density of synapses in the hippocampus of 16-18 month-old Tg2576 mice, we employed stereological and electron microscopic methods. Our findings indicated a decrease in the density of excitatory synapses in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 in cognitively impaired Tg2576 mice compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Intriguingly, through quantitative immunoelectron microscopy in the hippocampus of impaired and resilient Tg2576 transgenic AD mice, we uncovered differences in the subcellular localization of glutamate receptors. Specifically, the density of GluA1, GluA2/3, and mGlu5 in spines and dendritic shafts of CA1 pyramidal cells in impaired Tg2576 mice was significantly reduced compared with age-matched resilient Tg2576 and non-transgenic controls. Notably, the density of GluA2/3 in resilient Tg2576 mice was significantly increased in spines but not in dendritic shafts compared with impaired Tg2576 and non-transgenic mice.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying blood-brain barrier breakdown and translate them into therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, there is a growing demand for experimental models of human origin that allow for functional assessments. Recently, several human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived blood-brain barrier models have been established and various in vitro blood-brain barrier models using microdevices have been proposed. Especially in the Alzheimer's disease field, the human evidence for blood-brain barrier dysfunction has been demonstrated and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived blood-brain barrier models have suggested the putative molecular mechanisms of pathological blood-brain barrier. In this review, we summarize recent evidence of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease from pathological analyses, imaging studies, animal models, and stem cell sources. Additionally, we discuss the potential future directions for blood-brain barrier research.",

        "ArticleTitle": "How do neurons age? A focused review on the aging of the microtubular cytoskeleton.",
        "AbstractText": "Aging is the leading risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We now understand that a breakdown in the neuronal cytoskeleton, mainly underpinned by protein modifications leading to the destabilization of microtubules, is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This is accompanied by morphological defects across the somatodendritic compartment, axon, and synapse. However, knowledge of what occurs to the microtubule cytoskeleton and morphology of the neuron during physiological aging is comparatively poor. Several recent studies have suggested that there is an age-related increase in the phosphorylation of the key microtubule stabilizing protein tau, a modification, which is known to destabilize the cytoskeleton in Alzheimer's disease. This indicates that the cytoskeleton and potentially other neuronal structures reliant on the cytoskeleton become functionally compromised during normal physiological aging. The current literature shows age-related reductions in synaptic spine density and shifts in synaptic spine conformation which might explain age-related synaptic functional deficits. However, knowledge of what occurs to the microtubular and actin cytoskeleton, with increasing age is extremely limited. When considering the somatodendritic compartment, a regression in dendrites and loss of dendritic length and volume is reported whilst a reduction in soma volume/size is often seen. However, research into cytoskeletal change is limited to a handful of studies demonstrating reductions in and mislocalizations of microtubule-associated proteins with just one study directly exploring the integrity of the microtubules. In the axon, an increase in axonal diameter and age-related appearance of swellings is reported but like the dendrites, just one study investigates the microtubules directly with others reporting loss or mislocalization of microtubule-associated proteins. Though these are the general trends reported, there are clear disparities between model organisms and brain regions that are worthy of further investigation. Additionally, longitudinal studies of neuronal/cytoskeletal aging should also investigate whether these age-related changes contribute not just to vulnerability to disease but also to the decline in nervous system function and behavioral output that all organisms experience. This will highlight the utility, if any, of cytoskeletal fortification for the promotion of healthy neuronal aging and potential protection against age-related neurodegenerative disease. This review seeks to summarize what is currently known about the physiological aging of the neuron and microtubular cytoskeleton in the hope of uncovering mechanisms underpinning age-related risk to disease.",

Various studies have examined obstructive sleep apnoea, sleep duration, and circadian alterations in relation to Alzheimer's pathology and dementia risk, with an emerging body of evidence suggesting that cardiovascular disease, hypertension, glymphatic function, and inflammation might serve as plausible pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to dementia during critical brain periods. Conversely, recent studies investigating insomnia have produced disparate results. Regarding intervention studies, the scarcity of prospective randomised control trials poses a challenge in establishing the benefits of addressing sleep disorders and disturbances. Recent work examining the pathophysiological links between sleep and dementia is strongest for obstructive sleep apnoea and sleep duration, while findings in insomnia studies exhibit inconsistency, possibly due to varied associations with dementia among different insomnia subtypes. It is apparent that more longitudinal studies examining the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are necessary, alongside more rigorous clinical trials. Although some trials are underway in this field, there is still scarcity in trials examining interventions for circadian disturbances.",

A cPLA2-IVA inhibiting peptide was identified in the present work, aiming to develop an original therapeutic strategy. We targeted the cPLA2-IVA using the phage display technology. The hit peptide PLP25 was first validated in vitro (arachidonic acid dosage [AA], cPLA2-IVA cellular translocation) before being tested in vivo.

Showing a high affinity for the C2 domain of this enzyme, the peptide PLP25 exhibited an inhibitory effect on cPLA2-IVA activity by blocking its binding to its substrate, resulting in a decreased release of AA. Coupled to a vector peptide (LRPep2) in order to optimize brain access, we showed an improvement of cognitive abilities of APP/PS1 mice, which also exhibited a decreased number of amyloid plaques, a restored expression of cPLA2-IVA, and a favorable effect on NMDA receptor expression and tau protein phosphorylation. cPLA2-IVA inhibition through PLP25 peptide could be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Gut dysbiosis, a well-known risk factor to triggers the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is strongly associated with metabolic disturbance. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), produced in the dietary choline metabolism, has been found to accelerate neurodegeneration in AD pathology. In this study, the cognitive function and gut microbiota of TgCRND8 (Tg) mice of different ages were evaluated by Morris water maze task (MWMT) and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively. Young pseudo germ-free (PGF) Tg mice that received faecal microbiota transplants from aged Tg mice and wild-type (WT) mice were selected to determine the role of the gut microbiota in the process of neuropathology. Excessive choline treatment for Tg mice was used to investigate the role of abnormal choline metabolism on the cognitive functions. Our results showed that gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation response, A\u03b2 deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, TMAO overproduction and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)/transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurred in Tg mice age-dependently. Disordered microbiota of aged Tg mice accelerated AD pathology in young Tg mice, with the activation of CDK5/STAT3 signaling in the brains. On the contrary, faecal microbiota transplantation from WT mice alleviated the cognitive deficits, attenuated neuroinflammation, A\u03b2 deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, TMAO overproduction and suppressed CDK5/STAT3 pathway activation in Tg mice. Moreover, excessive choline treatment was also shown to aggravate the cognitive deficits, A\u03b2 deposition, neuroinflammation and CDK5/STAT3 pathway activation. These findings provide a novel insight into the interaction between gut dysbiosis and AD progression, clarifying the important roles of gut microbiota-derived substances such as TMAO in AD neuropathology.",

        "AbstractText": "\u03b2-Structure-rich amyloid fibrils are hallmarks of several diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and type 2 diabetes (T2D). While amyloid fibrils typically consist of parallel \u03b2-sheets, the anti-parallel \u03b2-hairpin is a structural motif accessible to amyloidogenic proteins in their monomeric and oligomeric states. Here, to investigate implications of \u03b2-hairpins in amyloid formation, potential \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic segments in the human proteome were predicted based on sequence similarity with \u03b2-hairpins previously observed in A\u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein, and islet amyloid polypeptide, amyloidogenic proteins associated with AD, PD, and T2D, respectively. These three \u03b2-hairpins, established upon binding to the engineered binding protein \u03b2-wrapin AS10, are characterized by proximity of two sequence segments rich in hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids, with high \u03b2-aggregation scores according to the TANGO algorithm. Using these criteria, 2505 potential \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic segments in 2098 human proteins were identified. Characterization of a test set of eight protein segments showed that seven assembled into Thioflavin T-positive aggregates and four formed \u03b2-hairpins in complex with AS10 according to NMR. One of those is a segment of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) comprising amino acids 185-208. PAP is naturally cleaved into fragments, including PAP(248-286) which forms functional amyloid in semen. We find that PAP(185-208) strongly decreases the protein concentrations required for fibril formation of PAP(248-286) and of another semen amyloid peptide, SEM1(86-107), indicating that it promotes nucleation of semen amyloids. In conclusion, \u03b2-hairpin-forming amyloidogenic protein segments could be identified in the human proteome with potential roles in functional or disease-related amyloid formation.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Does activation of oxytocinergic reward circuits postpone the decline of the aging brain?",
        "AbstractText": "Oxytocin supports reproduction by promoting sexual- and nursing behavior. Moreover, it stimulates reproductive organs by different avenues. Oxytocin is released to the blood from terminals of oxytocinergic neurons which project from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. Concomitantly, the dendrites of these neurons discharge oxytocin into neighboring areas of the hypothalamus. At this location it affects other neuroendocrine systems by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Moreover, sensory processing, affective functions, and reward circuits are influenced by oxytocinergic neurons that reach different sites in the brain. In addition to its facilitating impact on various aspects of reproduction, oxytocin is revealed to possess significant anti-inflammatory, restoring, and tranquilizing properties. This has been demonstrated both in many in-vivo and in-vitro studies. The oxytocin system may therefore have the capacity to alleviate detrimental physiological- and mental stress reactions. Thus, high levels of endogenous oxytocin may counteract inadequate inflammation and malfunctioning of neurons and supportive cells in the brain. A persistent low-grade inflammation increasing with age-referred to as inflammaging-may lead to a cognitive decline but may also predispose to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson. Interestingly, animal studies indicate that age-related destructive processes in the body can be postponed by techniques that preserve immune- and stem cell functions in the hypothalamus. It is argued in this article that sexual activity-by its stimulating impact on the oxytocinergic activity in many regions of the brain-has the capacity to delay the onset of age-related cerebral decay. This may also postpone frailty and age-associated diseases in the body. Finally, oxytocin possesses neuroplastic properties that may be applied to expand sexual reward. The release of oxytocin may therefore be further potentiated by learning processes that involves oxytocin itself. It may therefore be profitable to raise the consciousness about the potential health benefits of sexual activity particularly among the seniors.",

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been tested in AD, which has led to a decrease in either amyloid beta deposition or tau phosphorylation in cells. Likewise, genetic mutations in cells affected by PD have been corrected with promising results in initial studies undertaken.

To achieve this, we employed the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract relevant information from the sequential records of each patient. The hierarchical agglomerative clustering was then applied to the learned representation to group patients based on their progression subtypes. Our approach identified multiple progression pathways, each of which represented distinct patterns of disease progression from MCI to AD.

IDPs/IDRs exist as highly dynamic structural ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformations and are characterized by the exceptional structural heterogeneity, where their different parts are (dis)ordered to different degree, and their overall structure represents a complex mosaic of foldons, inducible foldons, inducible morphing foldons, non-foldons, semifoldons, and even unfoldons. Despite their lack of unique 3D structures, IDPs/IDRs play crucial roles in the control of various biological processes and the regulation of different cellular pathways and are commonly involved in recognition and signaling, indicating that the disorder-based functional repertoire is complementary to the functions of ordered proteins. Furthermore, IDPs/IDRs are frequently multifunctional, and this multifunctionality is defined by their structural flexibility and heterogeneity. Intrinsic disorder phenomenon is at the roots of the structure-function continuum model, where the structure continuum is defined by the presence of differently (dis)ordered regions, and the function continuum arises from the ability of all these differently (dis)ordered parts to have different functions. In their everyday life, IDPs/IDRs utilize a broad spectrum of interaction mechanisms thereby acting as interaction specialists.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis has had a significant influence in explaining the pathology underlying AD. Inhibiting the production and aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and promoting its clearance have been important strategies in the development of anti-AD drugs over the past two decades. Specifically, A\u03b2 directed antibodies have been highly anticipated, but drug development has been fraught with obstacles and challenges. Antibodies targeting the C-terminal or central region of A\u03b2, such as ponezumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab, primarily bind to A\u03b2 monomers, yet no significant clearance of brain plaques or slowing of disease progression has been observed in clinical trials. Antibodies targeting the N-terminal region of A\u03b2, including aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, primarily bind to aggregated forms of A\u03b2, and have shown efficacy in clearing brain plaques and slowing early-stage AD progression in clinical trials. However, clinical trials of gantenerumab, which targets conformational epitopes in the N-terminal and central sequences of A\u03b2 and which selectively binds to aggregated forms, have failed, raising some new questions about the A\u03b2 hypothesis. Advances in research on the pathological mechanisms of AD and advances in early diagnostic techniques may shift the time window for drug intervention and offer a potential pathway for developing effective drugs to delay the onset and progression of AD in the future.",

Synapsin 1 (SYN1), a neuronal phosphoprotein, is believed to be responsible for the pathology of AD. This study aimed to elucidate the exact role of SYN1 in ameliorating AD and its potential regulatory mechanisms. The AD dataset GSE48350 was downloaded from the GEO database, and SYN1 was focused on differential expression analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. After establishing an AD rat model, they were treated with RNAi lentivirus to trigger SYN1 overexpression. The amelioration of SYN1 in AD-associated behavior was validated using multiple experiments (water maze test and object recognition test). SYN1's repairing effect on the important factors in AD was confirmed by detecting the concentration of inflammatory factors (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1), neurotransmitters (acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HT)) and markers of oxidative stress (glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS)). Molecular biology experiments (qRT-PCR and western blot) were performed to examine AD-related signaling pathways after SYN1 overexpression. Differential expression analysis yielded a total of 545 differentially expressed genes, of which four were upregulated and 541 were downregulated. The enriched pathways were basically focused on synaptic functions, and the analysis of the protein- protein interaction network focused on the key genes in SYN1. SYN1 significantly improved the spatial learning and memory abilities of AD rats. This enhancement was reflected in the reduced escape latency of the rats in the water maze, the significantly extended dwell time in the third quadrant, and the increased number of crossings. Furthermore, the results of the object recognition test revealed reduced time for rats to explore familiar and new objects. After SYN1 overexpression, the cAMP signaling pathway was activated, the phosphorylation levels of the CREB and PKA proteins were elevated, and the secretion of neurotransmitters such as ACh, DA, and 5-HT was promoted. Furthermore, oxidative stress was suppressed, as supported by decreased levels of MDA and ROS. Regarding inflammatory factors, the levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly reduced in AD rats with SYN1 overexpression. SYN1 overexpression improves cognitive function and promotes the release of various neurotransmitters in AD rats by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory responses through cAMP signaling pathway activation.

The main objective is to investigate the effective role of capsaicin in attenuating cognitive dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and oxidative damage induced by scopolamine in mice and examine the feasible mechanisms. Various doses of capsaicin (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) were given orally to mice daily for 7 consecutive days after the administration of scopolamine. Various behavioral tests (motor coordination, locomotor counts, hole board test) and biochemical assay (Pro-inflammatory cytokines, catalase, lipid peroxidation, nitrite, reduced glutathione, and superoxide dismutase), mitochondrial complex (I, II, III, and IV) enzyme activities, and mitochondrial permeability transition were evaluated in the distinct regions of the brain. Scopolamine-treated mice showed a considerable reduction in the entries and duration in the light zone as well as in open arms of the elevated plus maze. Interestingly, capsaicin at different doses reversed the anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, and learning and memory impairment effects of scopolamine. Scopolamine-administered mice demonstrated substantially increased pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, impaired mitochondrial enzyme complex activities, and increased oxidative damage compared to the normal control group. Capsaicin treatment reinstated the reduced lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, catalase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione activity, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and restoring mitochondrial complex enzyme activities (I, II, III, and IV) as well as mitochondrial permeability. Moreover, the IL-1\u03b2 level was restored at a dose of capsaicin (10 and 20 mg/kg) only. Capsaicin reduced the scopolamine-induced acetylcholinesterase activity, thereby raising the acetylcholine concentration in the hippocampal tissues of mice. Preservation of neuronal cell morphology was also confirmed by capsaicin in histological studies. From the above experimental results, capsaicin at a dose of 10 mg/kg, p.o. for seven consecutive days was found to be the most effective dose. The experiential neuroprotective effect of capsaicin through the restoration of mitochondrial functions, antioxidant effects, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines makes it a promising candidate for further drug development through clinical setup.",

        "AbstractText": "Microbial communities in the intestinal tract are suggested to impact the ethiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The human microbiome might modulate neuroinflammatory processes and contribute to neurodegeneration in AD. However, the microbial compositions in patients with AD at different stages of the disease are still not fully characterized. We used 16S rRNA analyses to investigate the oral and fecal microbiota in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 84), at-risk individuals (APOE4 carriers; n = 17), and healthy controls (n = 50) and investigated the relationship of microbial communities and disease-specific markers via multivariate- and network-based approaches. We found a slightly decreased diversity in the fecal microbiota of patients with AD (average Chao1 diversity for AD = 212 [SD = 66]; for controls = 215 [SD = 55]) and identified differences in bacterial abundances including Bacteroidetes, Ruminococcus, Sutterella, and Porphyromonadaceae. The diversity in the oral microbiota was increased in patients with AD and at-risk individuals (average Chao1 diversity for AD = 174 [SD = 60], for at-risk group = 195 [SD = 49]). Gram-negative proinflammatory bacteria including Haemophilus, Neisseria, Actinobacillus, and Porphyromonas were dominant oral bacteria in patients with AD and MCI and the abundance correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid biomarker. Taken together, we observed a strong shift in the fecal and the oral communities of patients with AD already prominent in prodromal and, in case of the oral microbiota, in at-risk stages. This indicates stage-dependent alterations in oral and fecal microbiota in AD which may contribute to the pathogenesis via a facilitated intestinal and systemic inflammation leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",

        "AbstractText": "Apolipoprotein (apo) E4, being a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), is actively involved in the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, the principle constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. ApoE4 is believed to affect APP processing through intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, whereas lowering the cholesterol level by pharmacological agents has been suggested to reduce A\u03b2 production. This study has investigated the effects of hypolipidemic agents fenofibrate, and the flavonoids-naringenin and diosmetin-on apoE4-induced APP processing in rat neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with human wild-type APP 695 (B103-hAPP695wt). B103-hAPP695wt cells were pretreated with different doses of flavonoids and fenofibrate for 1 h prior to apoE4 exposure for 24 h. ApoE4-induced production of intra- and extracellular A\u03b2 peptides has been reduced with fenofibrate, naringenin, and diosmetin treatments. Pretreatment with diosmetin has significantly reduced apoE4-induced full-length APP (fl- APP) expression, whereas naringenin and fenofibrate had no effect on it. In addition, the increase in the apoE4-induced secretion of sAPPtotal and sAPP\u03b1 has been dose-dependently reduced with drug pretreatment. On the other hand, the decrease in the expression of both APP-carboxy terminal fragments (CTF)-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (generated by the \u03b1- or \u03b2-secretase cleavage of APP) by apoE4 was dose-dependently increased in cells pretreated with fenofibrate and naringenin but not diosmetin. Thus, we suggest that fenofibrate, naringenin, and diosmetin treatments can reduce apoE4- induced A\u03b2 production by distinct mechanisms that may prove useful in developing drugs for AD patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive impairment (CI) is a characteristic non-motor feature of Parkinson disease (PD) that poses a severe burden on the patients and caregivers, yet relatively little is known about its pathobiology. Cognitive deficits are evident throughout the course of PD, with around 25% of subtle cognitive decline and mild CI (MCI) at the time of diagnosis and up to 83% of patients developing dementia after 20 years. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neuropathological process, characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic striatonigral system and of many other neuronal systems, results not only in structural deficits but also extensive changes of functional neuronal network activities and neurotransmitter dysfunctions. Modern neuroimaging studies revealed multilocular cortical and subcortical atrophies and alterations in intrinsic neuronal connectivities. The decreased functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) in the bilateral prefrontal cortex is affected already before the development of clinical CI and in the absence of structural changes. Longitudinal cognitive decline is associated with frontostriatal and limbic affections, white matter microlesions and changes between multiple functional neuronal networks, including thalamo-insular, frontoparietal and attention networks, the cholinergic forebrain and the noradrenergic system. Superimposed Alzheimer-related (and other concomitant) pathologies due to interactions between \u03b1-synuclein, tau-protein and \u03b2-amyloid contribute to dementia pathogenesis in both PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). To further elucidate the interaction of the pathomechanisms responsible for CI in PD, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted that are supported by fluid and sophisticated imaging biomarkers as a basis for better early diagnosis and future disease-modifying therapies.",

Recently, there has been an increase in data regarding the involvement of not only dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra but also astrocytes in the pathogenesis of PD. Cell models based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives are a useful tool for studying the contribution and interaction of these two cell types in PD.

In this study, we hypothesized that coffee consumption suppresses neuroinflammation, which is closely related to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Using microglial BV-2 cells, we first found that the inflammatory responses induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation was diminished by both coffee and decaffeinated coffee through the inhibition of an inflammation-related transcription factor, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Pyrocatechol, a component of roasted coffee produced by the thermal decomposition of chlorogenic acid, also exhibited anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB. Finally, in an inflammation model using mice injected with LPS into the cerebrum, we observed that intake of pyrocatechol as well as coffee decoctions drastically suppressed the accumulation of microglia and the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), CCL2, and CXCL1 in the inflammatory brain. These observations strongly encourage us to hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory activity of pyrocatechol as well as coffee decoction would be useful for the suppression of neurodegeneration and the prevention of the onsets of Alzheimer's (AD) and Perkinson's diseases (PD).",

It holds a central role in the most popular and iconic Mexican celebration, \"the Day of the Dead\". Furthermore, it is currently receiving interest as a potential therapeutic agent, motivated mainly by its polyphenol content. The present study aims to evaluate the biological activity of an extract synthesized from the petals of the edible flower T. erecta. This extract showed significant antioxidant scores measured by the most common in vitro methodologies (FRAP, ABTS, and DPPH), with values of 1475.3 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, 1950.3 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, and 977.7 \u03bcM trolox/g extr, respectively. In addition, up to 36 individual polyphenols were identified by chromatography. Regarding the biomedical aspects of the petal extract, it exhibited antitumoral activity against ovarian carcinoma cells evaluated by the MTS assay, revealing a lower value of IC50 compared to other flower extracts. For example, the extract from T. erecta reported an IC50 value half as low as an extract from Rosa \u00d7 hybrida and six times lower than another extract from Tulbaghia violacea. This antitumoral effect of T. erecta arises from the induction of the apoptotic process; thus, incubating ovarian carcinoma cells with the petal extract increased the rate of apoptotic cells measured by flow cytometry. Moreover, the extract also demonstrated efficacy as a therapeutic agent against tauopathy, a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the Caenorhabditis elegans experimental model. Treating worms with the experimental extract prevented disfunction in several motility parameters such as wavelength and swimming speed. Furthermore, the T. erecta petal extract prevented the release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are associated with the progression of AD. Thus, treatment with the extract resulted in an approximate 20% reduction in ROS production. These findings suggest that these petals could serve as a suitable source of polyphenols for biomedical applications.",

Sociocognitive skills and social interactions present complex interdependencies with dementia which may be explained by two theories. According to the first one, not sufficiently engaging in social or cognitive activities results in brain atrophy. The second one claims that brain neurogenesis and synaptic density are being increased by social connections. The relationship between loneliness and dementia could be mediated by sensory loss, including hearing and visual impairment, as well as depression and psychotic symptoms. Loneliness itself might cause a depletion in sensory and cognitive stimulation which results in a decrease in neural reserve. Certain changes in the structures of the brain caused by loneliness were found in imaging examination. Loneliness appears to be a crucial risk factor for dementia in recent times due to the modern lifestyle and consequences of the outbreak of COVID-19.

Current data challenge the \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" that has prevailed in the field of AD, stating that A\u03b2 precedes and triggers Tau pathology that will eventually become the toxic entity in the progression of the disease. This perspective also led the field of therapeutic approaches towards the development of strategies that target A\u03b2 or Tau. In the present review, we discuss recent literature regarding the neurotoxic role of both A\u03b2 and Tau in AD, as well as their physiological function in the healthy brain. Consequently, we present studies suggesting that A\u03b2 and Tau act independently of each other in mediating neurotoxicity in AD, thereafter, re-evaluating the \"Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\" that places Tau pathology downstream of A\u03b2. More recent studies have confirmed that both A\u03b2 and Tau could propagate the disease and induce synaptic and memory impairments via the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This finding is not only interesting from a mechanistic point of view since it provides better insights into the AD pathogenesis but also from a therapeutic point of view since it renders APP a common downstream effector for both A\u03b2 and Tau.

Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for AD owing to its complicated pathogenesis. However, the development of lipid-lowering anti-inflammatory drugs has heralded a new era in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Several studies in recent years have shown that lipid metabolic dysregulation and neuroinflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of AD. 3-Hydroxyl 3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis that plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism. HMGCR inhibitors, known as statins, have changed from being solely lipid-lowering agents to neuroprotective compounds because of their effects on lipid levels and inflammation. In this review, we first summarize the main regulatory mechanism of HMGCR affecting cholesterol biosynthesis. We also discuss the pathogenesis of AD induced by HMGCR, including disordered lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, microglial proliferation, and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition. Subsequently, we explain the possibility of HMGCR as a potential target for AD treatment.

A total of 118 subjects, including relapsing-remitting MS with OCB (MS OCB+) (n = 58), without OCB (MS OCB-) (n = 24), and controls with other neurological diseases (OND) (n = 36), were included. CSF samples were analyzed by means of proximity extension assay (PEA) for quantifying 92 immune-related proteins. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of axonal damage, was also measured. Machine learning techniques were employed to identify biomarker panels differentiating MS with and without OCB from controls. Analyses were performed by splitting the cohort into a training and a validation set. CSF CD5 and IL-12B exhibited the highest discriminatory power in differentiating MS from controls. CSF MIP-1-alpha, CD5, CXCL10, CCL23 and CXCL9 were positively correlated with NfL. Multivariate models were developed to distinguish MS OCB+ and MS OCB- from controls.

He was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). PSEN1 His214Asn was initially reported in an Italian family, where the patient developed phenotypes similar to the current proband patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans revealed a mild hippocampal atrophy. The amyloid positron emission tomography (amyloid-PET) was positive, along with the positive test results of the increased amyloid \u00df (A\u03b2) oligomerization tendency with blood. The PSEN1 His214 amino acid position plays a significant role in the gamma-secretase function, especially from three additional reported mutations in this residue: His214Asp, His214Tyr, and His214Arg. The structure prediction model revealed that PSEN1 protein His214 may interact with Trp215 of His-Trp cation-\u03c0 interaction, and the mutations of His214 would destroy this interaction. The His-Trp cation-\u03c0 interaction between His214 and Trp215 would play a crucial structural role in stabilizing the 4th transmembrane domain of PSEN1 protein, especially when aromatic residues were often reported in the membrane interface of the lipid-extracellular region of alpha helices or beta sheets.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of Osthole against cognitive impairment in rats induced by D-galactose and elucidate its pharmacological mechanism. The rat model was established by subcutaneously injecting D-galactose at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day for 56 days.

Subsequently, a combination of in silico prediction and experimental validation was performed to verify the network-based predictions, using western blot, Nissl staining, and immunofluorescence. The results demonstrate that Osthole could improve memory dysfunction induced by D-galactose in Sprague Dawley male rats. A network proximity-based approach and integrated pathways analysis highlight two key AD-related pathological processes that may be regulated by Osthole, including neuronal apoptosis, i.e., neuroinflammation. Among them, the pro-apoptotic markers (Bax), anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), the microgliosis (Iba-1), Astro-cytosis (GFAP), and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-R1) were evaluated in both hippocampus and cortex.

        "AbstractText": "Patients with neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) often experience functional dysphagia, which may involve dysfunction in a specific phase of swallowing or in the entire process. This review outlines the approach to dysphagia in the setting of NDDs. Distinguishing the etiology of dysphagia can be difficult, and it is important to always look out for signs pointing to NDD as the cause. Thorough diagnostic work-up is essential, and it includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, alongside swallowing function tests, such as fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, videofluoroscopic swallowing study, and high-resolution manometry. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach with a treatment plan tailored to each patient. This involves dietary guidance, swallowing rehabilitation, and surgery in cases in which improvement with rehabilitation is inadequate. Surgery may involve altering certain pharyngolaryngeal structures to facilitate swallowing and reduce the risk of aspiration (swallowing improvement surgery) or separating the airway and digestive tract while sacrificing laryngeal function, with the main goal of preventing aspiration (aspiration prevention surgery). Proper management stems from recognizing the impact of these disorders on swallowing and consistently finding ways to improve the quality of life of patients.",

        "AbstractText": "Cordyceps, also known as \"zombie fungus\", is a non-poisonous mushroom that parasitizes insects for growth and development by manipulating the host system in a way that makes the victim behave like a \"zombie\". These species produce promising bioactive metabolites, like adenosine, \u03b2-glucans, cordycepin, and ergosterol. Cordyceps has been used in traditional medicine due to its immense health benefits, as it boosts stamina, appetite, immunity, longevity, libido, memory, and sleep. Neuronal loss is the typical feature of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) and neurotrauma. Both these conditions share common pathophysiological features, like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and glutamatergic excitotoxicity. Cordyceps bioactives (adenosine, N6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-adenosine, ergosta-7, 9 (11), 22-trien-3\u03b2-ol, active peptides, and polysaccharides) exert potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities and display beneficial effects in the management and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in vitro and in vivo. Although a considerable list of compounds is available from Cordyceps, only a few have been evaluated for their neuroprotective potential and still lack information for clinical trials. In this review, the neuroprotective mechanisms and safety profile of Cordyceps extracts/bioactives have been discussed, which might be helpful in the identification of novel potential therapeutic entities in the future.",

Animal studies have reported the positive effects of probiotics on these factors. Some clinical studies also support the potential role of probiotics in improving cognitive function via the gut-brain axis in older adults. However, clinical experimental studies evaluating the efficacy of probiotics targeting the neurotrophic factors and inflammatory biomarkers, particularly among AD patients, remain very limited. In this randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled trial, we used multi-strain probiotic supplements, including Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis BLI-02, B. breve Bv-889, B. animalis subsp. lactis CP-9, B. bifidum VDD088, and Lactobacillus plantarum PL-02 as the intervention. Participants were divided into an active control group (received probiotic supplements containing 5 \u00d7 107 colony-forming units per day, CFU/day) and a treatment group (1 \u00d7 1010 CFU/day). Student's t test was applied as the main method of statistical analysis. After 12 weeks of intervention, the treatment group demonstrated a 36% increase in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (* p = 0.005), a reduction in IL-1\u03b2 (* p = 0.041), and an increase in antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) (* p = 0.012). No significant change was found in the active control group. A trend toward less cognitive deterioration was observed, but not statistically significant. In conclusion, this study presents evidence supporting the benefits of multi-strain probiotics in enhancing BDNF, ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress in AD patients.",

BACE1 expression was observed in human PCa tissue samples, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), human PCa xenograft tissue in nude mice, and transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. Additionally, the downstream product of BACE1 activity, i.e., A\u03b21-42 expression, was also observed in these PCa tissues by IHC as well as by PET imaging in TRAMP mice. Furthermore, BACE1 gene expression and activity was confirmed in several established PCa cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2B-enzalutamide sensitive [S], C4-2B-enzalutamide resistant [R], 22Rv1-S, 22Rv1-R, PC3, DU145, and TRAMP-C1) by real-time PCR and fluorometric assay, respectively. Treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of BACE1 (MK-8931) strongly reduced the proliferation of PCa cells in in vitro and in vivo models, analyzed by multiple assays (MTT, clonogenic, and trypan blue exclusion assays and IHC). Cell cycle analyses revealed an increase in the sub-G1 population and a significant modulation in other cell cycle stages (G1/S/G2/M) following MK-8931 treatment. Most importantly, in vivo administration of MK-8931 intraperitoneal (30 mg/kg) strongly inhibited TRAMP-C1 allograft growth in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (approximately 81% decrease, p = 0.019). Furthermore, analysis of tumor tissue using the prostate cancer-specific pathway array revealed the alteration of several genes involved in PCa growth and progression including Forkhead O1 (FOXO1). All together, these findings suggest BACE1 as a novel therapeutic target in advanced PCa.",

Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",

This work examined the roles of two vitamin K2 (menaquinones) vitamers, namely, menaquinone-4 (MK4) and reduced menaquinone-7 (MK7R), as gene modulator compounds, as well as their potential role in the epigenetic regulation of genes involved in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation. The SK-N-BE human neuroblastoma cells provided a \"first-line\" model for screening the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative molecular pathways. MK7R, being a new vitamin K form, was first tested in terms of solubilization, uptake and cell viability, together with MK4 as an endogenous control. We assessed the expression of key factors in amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation, observing that the MK7R treatment was associated with the downregulation of neurodegeneration- (PSEN1 and BACE1) and neuroinflammation- (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) associated genes, whereas genes retaining protective roles toward amiloidogenesis were upregulated (ADAM10 and ADAM17). By profiling the DNA methylation patterns of genes known to be epigenetically regulated, we observed a correlation between hypermethylation and the downregulation of PSEN1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. These results suggest a possible role of MK7R in the treatment of cognitive impairment, giving a possible base for further preclinical experiments in animal models of neurodegenerative disease.",

Amongst the many proposed causes of AD, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis is gaining attention. Accumulating evidence shows that mitochondrial dysfunction is a driving force behind synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD patients. However, therapies targeting the mitochondria in AD have proven unsuccessful so far, and out-of-the-box options, such as hibernation-derived mitochondrial mechanisms, may provide valuable new insights. Hibernators uniquely and rapidly alternate between suppression and re-activation of the mitochondria while maintaining a sufficient energy supply and without acquiring ROS damage. Here, we briefly give an overview of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, how it affects synaptic function, and why mitochondrial targeting in AD has remained unsuccessful so far. We then discuss mitochondria in hibernation and daily torpor in mice, covering current advancements in hibernation-derived mitochondrial targeting strategies. We conclude with new ideas on how hibernation-derived dual mitochondrial targeting of both the ATP and ROS pathways may boost mitochondrial health and induce local synaptic protein translation to increase synaptic function and plasticity.

It seems reasonable to draw the attention of practicing physicians to the need to prevent cognitive dysfunction through dietary correction, probiotics and prebiotics intake. The purpose of the research was to study the possibility of using certain dietary patterns, as well as intake of probiotics and prebiotics for the correction of dysbiosis and early prevention of cognitive dysfunction, basing on the analysis of published data on the bidirectional communication between the colon microbiota and the brain and microbiota changes in patients with cognitive dysfunction and AD. Material and methods. We searched domestic and foreign literature devoted to gut microbiota, the \"gut-brain\" axis, microbiota disorders in AD patients; mechanisms of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration; the role of dietary patterns, in particular MIND diet, pre- and probiotics in the prevention of cognitive dysfunction - via PubMed search engine, SemanticScholar Google Internet search platform and domestic scientific electronic library Cyberleninka. 72 literature sources were analyzed. Results. Intestinal dysbiosis and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Changes in the microbiota in patients with cognitive impairment and AD are associated with disease severity and are generally characterized by increased numbers of Gram-negative microorganisms in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla and decreased numbers of Gram-positive microorganisms in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria phyla. An increase in gram-negative microorganisms abundance leads to elevated release of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that disrupt the integrity of the intestinal mucous barrier and, through a series of steps, initiate neuroinflammation. Course application of probiotics containing representatives of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus genera, in particular, Bifidobacterium breve A1 \u0438 Lactobacillus plantarum \u042129 strains, leads to improved cognitive function, which can be explained by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Long-term prospective studies of the effects of dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet clearly show delayed regression of cognitive function in older adults without initial dementia as well as in patients with AD. For example, according to various studies, individuals who have strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet for 6-9 years have a 23-39% lower risk of developing cognitive impairment. Adherence to the MIND diet for 6 years has a statistically significant association with higher verbal memory scores. Correction of gut dysbiosis, including through the administration of probiotics, prebiotics and bringing the diet to the MIND diet pattern, is the most affordable and rational method for early prevention of cognitive dysfunction. Conclusion. A promising strategy in the early prevention of neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment and dementia is to maintain the balance of the gut microbiota. The solution to this problem is achieved by adjusting the dietary pattern, increasing the use of dietary fiber and prebiotics and reasonable use of probiotics.",

However, recognizing the sensitivity of tau phosphorylation to various extrinsic factors, notably temperature, is vital for experimental accuracy. Hypothermia can trigger tau hyperphosphorylation, while hyperthermia leads to its dephosphorylation. Nevertheless, the rapidity of tau phosphorylation in response to unintentional temperature variations remains unknown. In cell cultures, the most significant temperature change occurs when the cells are removed from the incubator before harvesting, and in animal models, during anesthesia prior to euthanasia. In this study, we investigate the kinetics of tau phosphorylation in N2a and SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines, as well as in mice exposed to anesthesia. We observed changes in tau phosphorylation within the few seconds upon transferring cell cultures from their 37\u00b0C incubator to room temperature conditions. However, cells placed directly on ice post-incubation exhibited negligible phosphorylation changes. In vivo, isoflurane anesthesia rapidly resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation within the few seconds needed to lose the pedal withdrawal reflex in mice. These findings emphasize the critical importance of preventing temperature variation in researches focused on tau. To ensure accurate results, we recommend avoiding anesthesia before euthanasia and promptly placing cells on ice after removal from the incubator. By controlling temperature fluctuations, the reliability and validity of tau phosphorylation studies can be significantly enhanced.",

Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine A\u03b2-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of A\u03b2-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15\u00a0min) of A\u03b2-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0ng/mL).

This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04284384). At baseline, 1058 (15%) individuals had acquired hearing impairment with a hearing threshold of at least 25 decibel (dB) and, at follow-up, 1089 (15%) had dementia. In the total group, people with hearing impairment had a relative risk (RR) 1.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.09) per 10\u00a0dB increase in hearing thresholds. For individuals younger than 85 years at follow-up the RR was 1.12 (95% CI 1.05-1.21). Associations between hearing impairment and Alzheimer dementia and non-Alzheimer dementia were similar. There was no association for individuals aged at least 85 years. We found a moderate association between objectively measured hearing impairment and dementia in the younger age group (<85 years). The findings of no association in the older age group (\u226585 years) might be due to the competing risk of death. The present study adds to the literature showing that acquired hearing impairment is a risk for dementias over a period which is too long for reverse causation, and with thorough consideration of confounders. Further research is needed to investigate associations between the different aetiologies of hearing loss and dementia subtypes, and risk differences for sexes.

Approximately 15-25% of observations in humans do not fit predicted clinical manifestations, likely the result of suppressed damage despite usually adequate stressors and of resilience, the suppression of neurological dysfunction despite usually adequate degeneration. Factors during life may predict the clinico-pathologic state of resilience: cardiovascular health and mental health, more so than educational attainment, are predictive of a continuous measure of resilience to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRDs). In resilience to AD alone (RAD), core features include synaptic and axonal processes, especially in the hippocampus. Future focus on larger and more diverse cohorts and additional regions offer emerging opportunities to understand this counterforce to neurodegeneration.

Our lab previously developed an effective ASO strategy to lower human tau and reverse pathology in aged tauopathy model mice. Testing the efficacy of purchased tau lowering ASOs would provide support for these reagents as broad research tools. Purchased mouse and human tau lowering ASOs were infused or injected intracerebroventricularly into wildtype and tau transgenic mice. Following treatment, brain tissue evaluated for ASO distribution and levels of tau mRNA, protein, and phosphorylated tau. We show that purchased ASOs enter cell types of the brain and effectively decrease mouse or human tau mRNA and protein levels. Human tau lowering ASO treatment in PS19 mice decreased phosphorylated tau and gliosis relative to saline-treated PS19 mice, consistent with our previous study using a non-commercial tau lowering ASO. The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of purchased tau targeting ASOs in vivo to support their broad use by researchers.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunctional is a hallmark of age-related neurodegeneration including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impairment of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms leading to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and increasing neuronal stress. Therefore, investigating the basic mechanisms of how mitochondrial homeostasis is regulated is essential. Herein, we investigate the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a single sugar post-translational modification, in controlling mitochondrial stress-induced transcription factor Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response (ISRmt), in which the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 results in the translation of ATF4. We used patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, a transgenic mouse model of AD, SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and HeLa cell-lines to examine the effect of sustained O-GlcNAcase inhibition by Thiamet-G (TMG) on ISRmt using biochemical analyses. We show that TMG elevates ATF4 protein levels upon mitochondrial stress in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and HeLa cell-lines. An indirect downstream target of ATF4 mitochondrial chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75) is significantly elevated. Interestingly, knock-down of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc, in SH-SY5Y increases ATF4 protein and mRNA expression. Additionally, ATF4 target gene Activating Transcription Factor 5 (ATF5) is significantly elevated at both the protein and mRNA level. Brains isolated from TMG treated mice show elevated levels of ATF4 and GRP75. Importantly, ATF4 occupancy increases at the ATF5 promoter site in brains isolated from TMG treated mice suggesting that O-GlcNAc is regulating ATF4 targeted gene expression. Interestingly, ATF4 and GRP75 are not induced in TMG treated familial Alzheimer's Disease mice model. The same results are seen in a human in vitro model of AD. Together, these results indicate that in healthy conditions, O-GlcNAc regulates the ISRmt through regulating ATF4, while manipulating O-GlcNAc in AD has no effect on ISRmt.",

Because the breadth of Allo-induced responses requires activation of multiple systems of biology in the absence of an Allo-specific nuclear receptor, analyses were conducted in both neurons and astrocytes to identify unifying systems and signaling pathways. Mechanisms of Allo action were investigated in embryonic hippocampal neurons and astrocytes cultured in an Aging Model (AM) media. Cellular morphology, mitochondrial function, and transcriptomics were investigated followed by mechanistic pathway analyses. In hippocampal neurons, Allo significantly increased neurite outgrowth and synaptic protein expression, which were paralleled by upregulated synaptogenesis and long-term potentiation gene expression profiles. Mechanistically, Allo induced Ca2+/CREB signaling cascades. In parallel, Allo significantly increased maximal mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Complex IV activity while reducing oxidative stress, which required both the GABAA and L-type Ca2+ channels. In astrocytes, Allo increased ATP generation, mitochondrial function and dynamics while reducing oxidative stress, inflammasome indicators, and apoptotic signaling. Mechanistically, Allo regulation of astrocytic mitochondrial function required both the GABAA and L-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, Allo activated NRF1-TFAM signaling and increased the DRP1/OPA1 protein ratio, which led to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics. Collectively, the cellular, mitochondrial, transcriptional, and pharmacological profiles provide evidence in support of calcium signaling as a unifying mechanism for Allo pleiotropic actions in the brain.",

Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to arm movements during walking, and there is currently no consensus on gait asymmetry. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether arm motion and gait asymmetry could be utilized for identifying MCI and AD. In total, 102 middle-aged and elderly individuals were included in the final analysis and were assigned to the following three groups: AD (n = 27), MCI (n = 35), and a normal control group (n = 40). Gait and cognitive assessments were conducted for all participants. Gait detection included a single-task gait with free-speed walking and a dual-task gait with adding a cognitive task of successive minus seven to walking. Original gait parameters were collected using a wearable device featuring the MATRIX system 2.0. Gait parameters were shortened to several main gait domains through factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation. Subsequently, the extracted gait domains were used to differentiate the three groups, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated. Factor analysis of single-task gait identified five independent gait domains: rhythm symmetry, rhythm, pace asymmetry, arm motion, and variability. Factor analysis of the dual-task gait identified four gait domains: rhythm, variability, symmetry, and arm motion. During single-task walking, pace asymmetry was negatively correlated with MoCA scores and could distinguish between the AD group and the other two groups. Arm motion was not associated with MoCA scores, and did not exhibit adequate discrimination in either task. Currently, there is no reliable evidence suggesting that arm motion can be used to recognize AD or MCI. Gait asymmetry can serve as a potential gait marker for the auxiliary diagnosis of AD but not for MCI.",

However, an important question is the extent to which so-called \"normal-appearing\" non-lesional tissue in individuals with MS accumulate changes over the lifespan. Here, we compared post-mortem non-lesional brain tissue from donors with a pathological or clinical diagnosis of MS from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohorts to age- and sex-matched brains from persons without MS (controls). We profiled three brain regions using single-nucleus RNA-seq: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and the pulvinar in thalamus (PULV), from 15 control individuals, 8 individuals with MS, and 5 individuals with other detrimental pathologies accompanied by demyelination, resulting in a total of 78 samples. We identified region- and cell type-specific differences in non-lesional samples from individuals diagnosed with MS and/or exhibiting secondary demyelination with other neurological conditions, as compared to control donors. These differences included lower proportions of oligodendrocytes with expression of myelination related genes MOBP, MBP, PLP1, as well as higher proportions of CRYAB+ oligodendrocytes in all three brain regions. Among microglial signatures, we identified subgroups that were higher in both demyelination (TMEM163+/ERC2+), as well as those that were specifically higher in MS donors (HIF1A+/SPP1+) and specifically in donors with secondary demyelination (SOCS6+/MYO1E+), in both white and grey matter. To validate our findings, we generated Visium spatial transcriptomics data on matched tissue from 13 donors, and recapitulated our observations of gene expression differences in oligodendrocytes and microglia. Finally, we show that some of the differences observed between control and MS donors in NAWM mirror those previously reported between control WM and active lesions in MS donors.

        "AbstractText": "Tau is a microtubule-associated protein often found in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beyond this context, mounting evidence suggests that tau localizes into the nucleus, where it may play a role in DNA protection and heterochromatin regulation. Models of tau depletion or pathology show loss of genetically silent heterochromatin, aberrant expression of heterochromatic genes, and transposable element activation. The molecular mechanisms behind these observations are currently unclear. Using in vitro biophysical experiments, here we demonstrate that tau can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with DNA, mononucleosomes, and reconstituted nucleosome arrays under low salt conditions. Low concentrations of tau promote chromatin compaction and protect DNA from digestion. While the material state of samples at physiological salt is dominated by chromatin oligomerization, tau can still associate strongly and reversibly with nucleosome arrays. These properties are driven by tau's strong interactions with linker and nucleosomal DNA, while magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments show that tau binding does not drastically alter nucleosome structure and dynamics. In addition, tau co-localizes into droplets formed by nucleosome arrays and phosphorylated HP1\u03b1, a key heterochromatin constituent thought to function through an LLPS mechanism. Importantly, LLPS and chromatin interactions are disrupted by aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. These biophysical properties suggest that tau may directly impact DNA and chromatin accessibility and that loss of these interactions could contribute to the aberrant nuclear effects seen in tau pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "Exosomes are proposed to be important in the pathogenesis of prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. We report the first application of solid-state technology to perform multiplex analysis of single exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the lumbar sac of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD, n=30) or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD, n=30), as well as age-matched health controls (HCN, n=30). Single events were captured with mouse monoclonal antibodies to one of three different tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, or CD81) or with mouse (M) IgG control, and then probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies to prion protein (PrP) or CD47 to mark neuronal or presynaptic origin, as well as ADD- and PDD-related proteins: amyloid beta (A\u03b2), tau, \u03b1-synuclein, and Apolipoprotein (Apo) E. Data were collected only from captured events that were within the size range of 50 to 200 nm. Exosomes were present at approximately 100 billion per mL human CSF and were similarly abundant for CD9+ and CD81+ events, but CD63+ were only 22% to 25% of CD9+ (P<0.0001) or CD81+ (P<0.0001) events. Approximately 24% of CSF exosomes were PrP+, while only 2% were CD47+. The vast majority of exosomes were surface ApoE+, and the number of PrP-ApoE+ (P<0.001) and PrP+ApoE+ (P<0.01) exosomes were significantly reduced in ADD vs. HCN for CD9+ events only. A\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-synuclein were not detected on the exosome surface or in permeabilized cargo. These data provide new insights into single exosome molecular features and highlight reduction in the CSF concentration of ApoE+ exosomes in patients with ADD.",

Signals in metabolic pathways conserved across species provides a promising entry point for translation. METHODS: We investigated differences of serum and brain metabolites between the early-onset 5XFAD and late-onset LOAD1 (APOE4.Trem2*R47H) mouse models of AD to C57BL/6J controls at six months of age. We identified sex differences for several classes of metabolites, such as glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and amino acids. Metabolic signatures were notably different between brain and serum in both mouse models. The 5XFAD mice exhibited stronger differences in brain metabolites, whereas LOAD1 mice showed more pronounced differences in serum. Several of our findings were consistent with results in humans, showing glycerophospholipids reduction in serum of APOE4 carriers and replicating the serum metabolic imprint of the APOE4 genotype. Our work thus represents a significant step towards translating metabolic dysregulation from model organisms to human AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Sleep-wake scoring is a time-consuming, tedious but essential component of clinical and pre-clinical sleep research. Sleep scoring is even more laborious and challenging in rodents due to the smaller EEG amplitude differences between states and the rapid state transitions which necessitate scoring in shorter epochs. Although many automated rodent sleep scoring methods exist, they do not perform as well when scoring new data sets, especially those which involve changes in the EEG/EMG profile. Thus, manual scoring by expert scorers remains the gold-standard. Here we take a different approach to this problem by using a neural network to accelerate the scoring of expert scorers. Sleep-Deep-Net (SDN) creates a bespoke deep convolution neural network model for individual electroencephalographic or local-field-potential records via transfer learning of GoogleNet, by learning from a small subset of manual scores of each EEG/LFP record as provided by the end-user. SDN then automates scoring of the remainder of the EEG/LFP record. A novel REM scoring correction procedure further enhanced accuracy. SDN reliably scores EEG and LFP data and retains sleep-wake architecture in wild-type mice, in sleep induced by the hypnotic zolpidem, in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in a genetic knock-down study, when compared to manual scoring. SDN reduced manual scoring time to 1/12. Since SDN uses transfer learning on each independent recording, it is not biased by previously scored existing data sets. Thus, we find SDN performs well when used on signals altered by a drug, disease model or genetic modification.",

To treat complex neurodegenerative disorders, where pathogenesis is driven by multiple genes or pathways, di-valent siRNA must be able to silence multiple target genes simultaneously. Here we present a framework for designing unimolecular \"dual-targeting\" di-valent siRNAs capable of co-silencing two genes in the CNS. We reconfigured di-valent siRNA - in which two identical, linked siRNAs are made concurrently - to create linear di-valent siRNA - where two siRNAs are made sequentially attached by a covalent linker. This linear configuration, synthesized using commercially available reagents, enables incorporation of two different siRNAs to silence two different targets. We demonstrate that this dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is fully functional in the CNS of mice, supporting at least two months of maximal target silencing. Dual-targeting di-valent siRNA is highly programmable, enabling simultaneous modulation of two different disease-relevant gene pairs (e.g., Huntington's disease: MSH3 and HTT; Alzheimer's disease: APOE and JAK1) with similar potency to a mixture of single-targeting di-valent siRNAs against each gene. This work potentiates CNS modulation of virtually any pair of disease-related targets using a simple unimolecular siRNA.",

        "AbstractText": "Aging and sex are major risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer's disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development. We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 (WT) control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain, liver, spleen, and plasma samples (n=3-8 mice per sex, strain, and age group). We performed histological analyses on all tissues and assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, as well as splenic mass and morphology. Additionally, we measured concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer's and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study in each sex. 3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer's neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and next to no Alzheimer's neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, further suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Clinical investigations revealed that 3xTg-AD brain aging phenotypes are not an artifact of the animal model, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in canonical pathways related to neuronal signaling and immune function. Interestingly, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs in diseased males of both species. Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease trajectories. We propose a model of disease pathogenesis in 3xTg-AD males in which aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger an inflammatory response, mimicking the effects of LPS stimulation despite the absence of infection.",

This is particularly significant in individuals who already have Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the cognitive impairments can be more pronounced in these cases. However, the extent and underlying mechanisms of cognitive impairments in COVID-19-infected AD patients have yet to be fully investigated through clinical and neurophysiological approaches. This study included a total of 77 AD patients. Cognitive functions were assessed using neuropsychiatric scales for all participants, and plasma biomarkers of amyloid protein and tau protein were measured in a subset of 25 participants. To investigate the changes in functional brain connectivity induced by COVID-19 infection, a cross-sectional neuroimaging design was conducted involving a subset of 37 AD patients, including a control group of 18 AD participants without COVID-19 infection and a COVID-19 group consisting of 19 AD participants.

The COVID-19-infected AD patients show decreased local coherence (LCOR) in the anterior middle temporal gyrus and decreased global correlation (GCOR) in the precuneus and the medial prefrontal cortex.

Cerebrovascular disease correlates with cardiovascular disease and is complicated in \u224840% of AD patients. The protein kinase C (PKC) \u03b5 activator DCPLA can stimulate human antigen (Hu) R that prevents degradation and promotes the translation of mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) mRNAs. To induce brain microinfarcts, we injected triple transgenic (3\u00d7Tg) and wild-type (WT) control mice with microbeads (20\u2009\u03bcm caliber) into common carotid arteries, with or without the DCPLA-ME (methyl-ester) for 2\u2009weeks. After water maze training, mice at 16\u2009months old were examined for confocal immunohistochemistry at a single cell or microvessel level in the hippocampal CA1 area, important for spatial memory storage, and in the dorsal hippocampus by western blots. In 3\u00d7Tg mice without cerebral microinfarcts, an accelerating age-related increase in (mild) oxidative stress and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, but a reduction in VEGF, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), and MnSOD were associated with capillary loss. The change was less pronounced in arterioles. However, in 3\u00d7Tg mice with cerebral microinfarcts, increasing arteriolar diameter and their wall cells were related with the strong oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3), and sustained hypoxia (increased HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF/PKC\u03b5/extracellular signal regulated kinase or ERK pathway). Microocclusion enhanced the loss of the synaptic marker spinophilin, astrocytic number, and astrocyte-vascular coupling areas and demyelination of axons. DCPLA-ME prevented spatial memory defect; strong oxidative stress-related apoptosis; sustained hypoxia (by reducing HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF); and exaggerated cell repair in arteriolar walls, pericapillary space dilation, neuro-glial-vascular disruption, and demyelination. In conclusion, in 3\u00d7Tg mice with cerebral microinfarcts, sustained hypoxia (increased HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF signals) is dominant with arteriolar wall thickening, and DCPLA has a protective effect on sustained hypoxia.",

The current study aims to investigate the impact of ADA on cognitive ability in a sporadic AD model and explore its potential mechanism. Apoe4 mouse was adopted for evaluating the impact of AGA on cognitive impairment through a serious of behavioral tests. The molecular mechanism of ADA involved in mitophagy and neuroinflammation was investigated in detailby Western blot, ELISA, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy in Apoe4 mice, as well as Apoe4-transfected BV2 cells and HT22 cells. ADA application significantly improved cognitive impairment of Apoe4 mice, and lessened A\u03b2 load and neuronal damage, which has stronger activity than its prototype AGA. Accumulated mitophagy markers LC3II, P62, TOM20, PINK1 and Parkin, and decreased mitophagy receptor BNIP3 in hippocampus of Apoe4 mice were greatly reversed after ADA treatment. Meanwhile, ADA promoted the recruitment of BNIP3 to mitochondria, and the transport of damaged mitochondria to lysosome, indicating that disturbed mitophagy in AD mice was restored by ADA.

Additionally, damaged mitophagy and/or activated NLRP3 inflammasome were also observed in BV2 cells and HT22 cells transfected with Apoe4, all of which were rescued by ADA incubation. Noteworthily, SIRT3 inhibitor 3-TYP could abolish the impact of ADA on mitophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro. ADA exerted stronger cognition-enhancing ability in relative to AGA, and ADA could repaire mitophagy deficiency via SIRT3-FOXO3a pathway, and subsequently inhibite NLRP3 inflammasome to mitigate AD pathology.",

We analyzed the data using a machine learning approach by implementing four well-known and widely-used classifiers and feature selection. The experimental results showed that the feature selection allowed us to derive a different set of highly distinctive features for each word type.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and dementia are among the highly prevalent neurological disorders characterized by deposition of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques, dense deposits of highly phosphorylated tau proteins, insufficiency of acetylcholine (ACh) and imbalance in glutamatergic system. Patients typically experience cognitive, behavioral alterations and are unable to perform their routine activities. Evidence also suggests that inflammatory processes including excessive microglia activation, high expression of inflammatory cytokines and release of free radicals. Thus, targeting inflammatory pathways beside other targets might be the key factors to control- disease symptoms and progression. This review is aimed to highlight the mechanisms and pathways involved in the neuroprotective potentials of lead phytochemicals. Further to provide updates regarding challenges associated with their use and their progress into clinical trials as potential lead compounds. Most recent scientific literature on pre-clinical and clinical data published in quality journals especially on the lead phytochemicals including curcumin, catechins, quercetin, resveratrol, genistein and apigenin was collected using SciFinder, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, JSTOR, EBSCO, Scopus and other related web sources. Literature review indicated that the drug discovery against AD is insufficient and only few drugs are clinically approved which have limited efficacy. Among the therapeutic options, natural products have got tremendous attraction owing to their molecular diversity, their safety and efficacy. Research suggest that natural products can delay the disease onset, reduce its progression and regenerate the damage via their anti-amyloid, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials. These agents regulate the pathways involved in the release of neurotrophins which are implicated in neuronal survival and function. Highly potential lead phytochemicals including curcumin, catechins, quercetin, resveratrol, genistein and apigenin regulate neuroprotective signaling pathways implicated in neurotrophins-mediated activation of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) and p75 neurotrophins receptor (p75NTR) family receptors. Phytochemicals especially phenolic compounds were identified as highly potential molecules which ameliorate oxidative stress induced neurodegeneration, reduce A\u03b2 load and inhibit vital enzymes. Yet their clinical efficacy and bioavailability are the major challenges which need further interventions for more effective therapeutic outcomes.",

        "AbstractText": "In this study, we evaluated the change in the level of lipofuscin, an autofluorescent aging pigment, in brain and peripheral tissues in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) - 5xFAD. A comparative analysis of the content of lipofuscin in homogenates of the liver, kidneys, heart, and various parts of the brain of 5xFAD mice, as well as control mice from the same litters of different ages, was carried out. The data obtained correlate well with the concept of lipofuscin as an aging pigment - its amount increases with age in both control and 5xFAD mice. We noted accumulation of lipofuscin progressive with age in 5xFAD mice, which is detected both in different parts of the brain and in peripheral organs. At the same time, the level of lipofuscin was increased even in newborn day-old mice 5xFAD. Thus, an increase in the level of lipofuscin in 5xFAD mice is one of the earliest disorders that manifests itself not only in the brain, but also in other organs.",

Despite many studies seeking to identify and develop effective therapies, effective ALS treatment has yet to be approved. Hence, patients with ALS ultimately experience muscle atrophy and loss of motor neurons. Herbal medicines have been used to treat numerous diseases by modulating multiple biological processes and exerting pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In particular, Chaenomeles sinensis Koehne (CS) exhibits anti-hyperuricemic and nephroprotective effects and is used to treat anaphylaxis, viral infections, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study monitored the effects of CS supplementation on muscle function and motor neurons in hSOD1G93A mice, an established ALS animal model. Body weight measurements and behavioral tests were performed; additionally, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted using the mice gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and spinal cord. CS augmented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in the muscle and spinal cord of hSOD1G93A mice. Furthermore, CS improved motor function and regulated autophagy in the muscles of the hSOD1G93A mice. CS might represent a promising supplement for improving motor function and delaying ALS progression. However, its development for clinical use warrants further investigation.",

        "ArticleTitle": "A More Holistic Perspective of Alzheimer's Disease: Roles of Gut Microbiome, Adipocytes, HPA Axis, Melatonergic Pathway and Astrocyte Mitochondria in the Emergence of Autoimmunity.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease is widely regarded as poorly treated due to poor conceptualization. For 40 years, Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology has focused on two culprits, amyloid-\u03b2 induced plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau associated tangles, with no significant treatment advance. This is confounded by data showing amyloid-\u03b2 to be an endogenous antimicrobial that is increased in a wide array of diverse medical conditions associated with heightened inflammation. This article reviews the wider bodies of data pertaining to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, highlighting the role of suppressed astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway as a core hub in driving neuronal loss in dementia. It is proposed that astrocyte function over aging becomes dysregulated, at least partly mediated by systemic processes involving the 10-fold decrease in pineal melatonin leading to the attenuated capacity of night-time melatonin to dampen residual daytime inflammation. Suppressed pineal melatonin also attenuates melatonin's inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, thereby changing not only stress/hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis consequences but also the consequences of the cortisol awakening response, which 'primes the body for the coming day'. Gut microbiome-derived butyrate also inhibits glucocorticoid receptor nuclear translocation, as well as inducing the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. It is proposed that the loss of astrocyte melatonin prevents the autocrine and paracrine effects of melatonin in limiting amyloid-\u03b2 levels and effects. Suppressed astrocyte melatonin production also attenuates the melatonin induction of astrocyte lactate, thereby decreasing neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and the neuronal mitochondrial melatonergic pathway. The loss of astrocyte lactate and melatonin, coupled to the suppression of neuronal mitochondrial metabolism and melatonin production decreases mitophagy, leading to the induction of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1. MHC-1 initiates the chemoattraction of CD8+ t cells, leading to neuronal destruction in Alzheimer's disease being driven by 'autoimmune'/'immune-mediated' processes. Alzheimer's disease may therefore be conceptualized as being initiated by systemic processes that act on astrocytes as a core hub, with the suppression of the astrocyte melatonergic pathway leaving neurons deplete of appropriate metabolic substrates and co-ordinated antioxidants. This culminates in an 'immune-mediated' cell death. Future research and treatment/prevention implications are indicated.",

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was used to assess BPS. A total of 358 consecutive patients with first-ever stroke admitted to rehabilitation wards and with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores < 24 on admission were included. BPS was defined as a total NPI-Q Severity or Distress score \u2265 1. Differences between the severity and presence of BPS among patients with severe cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 0-17) and those with mild cognitive impairment (MMSE scores 18-23) were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test and chi-squared test, respectively. Eighty-one patients (mean (standard deviation) age, 73.5 (13.1) years) were enrolled for analysis. BPS were observed in 69.1% and 74.1% of patients when assessed with NPI-Q Severity and NPI-Q Distress, respectively. The most frequently observed BPS was apathy, followed by depression (approximately 44% and 40%, respectively). The severity and frequency of delusions, euphoria, apathy, and disinhibition were significantly higher in the severe cognitive impairment group than in the mild cognitive impairment group. However, the severity, distress, and frequency of depression were not dependent on the severity of cognitive impairment. The presence of BPS, especially apathy and depression, in subacute stroke patients with cognitive impairment is high. The severity and frequency of some BPS are higher in patients with severe cognitive impairment than in those with mild cognitive impairment. However, depression is highly prevalent among the patients regardless of the severity of cognitive impairment.",

This study investigated the associated independent risk factors and established a nomogram prediction model. Totally 734 elderly patients with hip fractures who underwent surgical treatment (January 2016-December 2020) were enrolled. Following analyses on demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and laboratory examination, independent risk factors of contralateral hip fractures in the elderly were identified through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Patients were randomly allocated into training (n =\u2009513) and validation sets (n =\u2009221). A training set-based nomogram prediction model was established and assessed for predictability, discriminatory ability, and clinical applicability using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) in both sets. Contralateral hip refractures occurred in 7.08% (52/734) patients within 2\u2009years after surgery. Age, hemoglobin (Hb), heart disease, neurovascular disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were independent risk factors. The nomogram prediction model had a favorable discriminatory ability, as indicated by the areas under the ROC curves (AUC): 0.906 (95% CI, 0.845-0.967) in the training set and 0.956 (95% CI, 0.927-0.985) in the validation set. The calibration curves demonstrated a good consistency between the actual subsequent contralateral hip fracture incidence and the predicted probability. The DCA of the nomogram demonstrated the model's excellent clinical efficacy. The nomogram model enabled accurate individualized prediction for the occurrence of subsequent contralateral hip fracture in the elderly within 2\u2009years after surgical treatment, which might help clinicians with precise references for appropriate perioperative management and rehabilitation education following initial hip surgery for their patients.",

Given the merits of using volumetric meshes in applications like brain image analysis, we introduce a novel interpretable graph CNN framework for the tetrahedral mesh structure. Inspired by ChebyNet, our model exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of 3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally, adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used unitary cortical thickness, graph Laplacian, and point cloud representation.",

Moreover, free copper accumulation triggers a specific form of cell death, namely copper-dependent cell death (cuproptosis). This article aimed to review the correlation between copper dysregulation and the pathogenesis of AD, along with the primary pathways regulating copper homoeostasis and copper-induced death in AD. Additionally, the efficacy and safety of natural and synthetic agents, including copper chelators, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, and antioxidants, were examined.

        "AbstractText": "Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) is a potential hallmark for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as it construes the genetic expression level, giving insights into the pathological progress from the outset. Profiles of cfRNA in Caucasian AD patients have been investigated thoroughly, yet there was no report exploring cfRNAs in the ASEAN groups. This study examined the gap, expecting to support the development of point-of-care AD diagnosis. cfRNA profiles were characterized from 20 Vietnamese plasma samples (10 probable AD and 10 age-matched controls). RNA reads were subjected to differential expression (DE) analysis. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify gene modules that were significantly co-expressed. These modules' expression profiles were then correlated with AD status to identify relevant modules. Genes with the highest intramodular connectivity (module membership) were selected as hub genes. Transcript counts of differentially expressed genes were correlated with key AD measures-MMSE and MTA scores-to identify potential biomarkers. 136 genes were identified as significant AD hallmarks (p < 0.05), with 52 downregulated and 84 upregulated in the AD cohort. 45.6% of these genes are highly expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. Notably, all markers related to chronic inflammation were upregulated, and there was a significant shift in all apoptotic markers. Three co-expressed modules were found to be significantly correlated with Alzheimer's status (p < 0.05; R2> 0.5). Functional enrichment analysis on these modules reveals an association with focal adhesion, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and metal ion response leading to apoptosis, suggesting the potential participation of these pathways in AD pathology. 47 significant hub genes were found to be differentially expressed genes with the highest connectivity. Six significant hub genes (CREB1, YTHDC1, IL1RL1, PHACTR2, ANKRD36B, RNF213) were found to be significantly correlated with MTA and MMSE scores. Other significant transcripts (XRN1, UBB, CHP1, THBS1, S100A9) were found to be involved in inflammation and neuronal death. Overall, we have identified candidate transcripts in plasma cf-RNA that are differentially expressed and are implicated in inflammation and apoptosis, which can jumpstart further investigations into applying cf-RNA as an AD biomarker in Vietnam and ASEAN countries.",

The choroid plexus product is the main transporter of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) to the brain during early development. TTR is one of three relatively abundant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins (Apolipoprotein J [ApoJ] (also known as clusterin), Apolipoprotein E [ApoE], and TTR) that interact with A\u03b2 peptides in vitro, in some instances inhibiting their aggregation and toxicity. It is now clear that clusterin functions as an extracellular, and perhaps intracellular, chaperone for many misfolded proteins and that variation in its gene (Clu) is associated with susceptibility to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The function of ApoE in AD is not yet completely understood, although the ApoE4 allele has the strongest genetic association with the development of sporadic late onset AD. Despite in vitro and in vivo evidence of the interaction between TTR and A\u03b2, genomewide association studies including large numbers of sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients have failed to show significant association between variation in the TTR gene and disease prevalence. Early clinical studies suggested an inverse relationship between CSF TTR levels and AD and the possibility of using the reduced CSF TTR concentration as a biomarker. Later, more extensive analyses indicated that CSF TTR concentrations may be increased in some patients with AD. While the observed changes in TTR may be pathogenetically or biologically interesting because of the inconsistency and lack of specificity, they offered no benefit diagnostically or prognostically either independently or when added to currently employed CSF biomarkers, i.e., decreased A\u03b21-42 and increased Tau and phospho-Tau. While some clinical data suggest that increases in CSF TTR may occur early in the disease with a significant decrease late in the course, without additional, more granular data, CSF TTR changes are neither consistent nor specific enough to warrant their use as a specific AD biomarker.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Identification of a lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA Network in Alzheimer's Disease.",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in the elderly and pre-elderly, characterized by decline of memory, cognitive dysfunction, impairment of learning capacity, and motor dysfunction. Recently a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network has been found to be related to AD progression, but there is still little understanding of the ceRNA regulatory network in AD. This study aims to explore the important regulatory mechanisms of ceRNA regulatory networks containing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in AD. Data from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database were used for the analysis. To study enrichment function for the upregulated and downregulated mRNAs, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the Metascape database, respectively. Based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software 3.9.1, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The hub genes in this network were identified utilizing the CytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape. The TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB were selected to calculate the regulatory interaction between miRNAs and the hub genes. LncRNAs were predicted using RNA22. Additionally, circRNA prediction was executed using the circBank database. 711 downregulated and 670 upregulated overlapping mRNAs were identified between AD and control samples. 32 downregulated and 340 upregulated miRNAs were obtained from AD samples compared with control samples. 78 upregulated and 205 downregulated circRNAs were screened. 275 upregulated lncRNAs and 209 downregulated lncRNAs were found between AD samples and control samples. The PPI network constructed consists of 1016 nodes and 13,946 edges. Ten hub genes were selected to identify target miRNAs and ceRNAs. On the basis of the ceRNA hypothesis, a circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was established. It included five lncRNAs (TRHDE-AS1, SNHG10, OIP5-AS, LINC00926 and LINC00662), 26 circRNAs, five miRNAs (hsa-miR-3158-3p, hsa-miR-4435, hsa-let-7d-3p, hsa-miR-330-5p and hsa-miR-3605-3p), and ten mRNAs (RPL11, RPL34, RPL21, RPL22, RPL6, RPL32, RPL24, RPL35, RPL31, and RPL35A). RPL35 and RPL35A were found to be significantly associated with AD pathology in tau and A\u03b2 line AD models by the AlzData database. The study discovered the significance of several lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes that included RPL35A and RPL35. ceRNAs were found to be important regulators in the development of AD and provide potential biological therapy targets for AD management.",

        "AbstractText": "Containing the medical data of millions of patients, clinical data warehouses (CDWs) represent a great opportunity to develop computational tools. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are particularly sensitive to patient movements during image acquisition, which will result in artefacts (blurring, ghosting and ringing) in the reconstructed image. As a result, a significant number of MRIs in CDWs are corrupted by these artefacts and may be unusable. Since their manual detection is impossible due to the large number of scans, it is necessary to develop tools to automatically exclude (or at least identify) images with motion in order to fully exploit CDWs. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method from research to clinical data for the automatic detection of motion in 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. The method consists of two steps: a pre-training on research data using synthetic motion, followed by a fine-tuning step to generalise our pre-trained model to clinical data, relying on the labelling of 4045 images. The objectives were both (1) to be able to exclude images with severe motion, (2) to detect mild motion artefacts. Our approach achieved excellent accuracy for the first objective with a balanced accuracy nearly similar to that of the annotators (balanced accuracy>80 %). However, for the second objective, the performance was weaker and substantially lower than that of human raters. Overall, our framework will be useful to take advantage of CDWs in medical imaging and highlight the importance of a clinical validation of models trained on research data.",

This study is aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of Pioglitazone in improving cognitive function in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Trials published in the last 12 years were identified from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central, and other trial registries. Five hundred twenty-five records were obtained, from which five studies were included for quantitative analysis. Studies comparing Pioglitazone with a suitable placebo or other oral hypoglycemic agent were considered for review. Data was extracted using a pretested form, which was followed by a risk of bias assessment (ROB) with Cochrane's ROB assessment tool. This meta-analysis included studies where Pioglitazone (15-30 mg) was compared to other oral hypoglycemic agents, placebo, or diabetic diet for a minimum duration of 6 months. Pioglitazone did not show a statistically significant improvement in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores [mean difference (MD): -1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.14-1.81]. By conducting sensitivity analysis with the removal of one study, significant efficacy was obtained [MD: -2.75; 95% CI: -4.84--0.66]. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised logical memory I (WMS-R) scores had a significant improvement in the Pioglitazone group [MD: 2.02; 95% CI: 0.09-3.95].

        "AbstractText": "The role of small vessel disease in the development of dementia is not yet completely understood. Functional brain connectivity has been shown to differ between individuals with and without cerebral small vessel disease. However, a comprehensive measure of small vessel disease quantifying the overall damage on the brain is not consistently used and studies using such measure in mild cognitive impairment individuals are missing. Functional brain connectivity differences were analyzed between mild cognitive impairment individuals with absent or low (n\u00a0=\u00a034) and high (n\u00a0=\u00a034) small vessel disease burden using data from the Parelsnoer Institute, a Dutch multicenter study. Small vessel disease was characterized using an ordinal scale considering: lacunes, microbleeds, perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia, and white matter hyperintensities. Resting state functional MRI data using 3 Tesla scanners was analyzed with group-independent component analysis using the CONN toolbox. Functional connectivity between areas of the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and the thalamus and caudate nucleus was higher in the absent or low small vessel disease group compared to the high small vessel disease group. These findings might suggest that functional connectivity of mild cognitive impairment individuals with low or absent small vessel disease burden is more intact than in mild cognitive impairment individuals with high small vessel disease. These brain areas are mainly responsible for motor, attentional and executive functions, domains which in previous studies were found to be mostly associated with small vessel disease markers. Our results support findings on the involvement of the cerebellum in cognitive functioning.",

        "AbstractText": "Genetic associations with macroscopic brain networks can provide insights into healthy and aberrant cortical connectivity in disease. However, associations specific to dynamic functional connectivity in Alzheimer's disease are still largely unexplored. Understanding the association between gene expression in the brain and functional networks may provide useful information about the molecular processes underlying variations in impaired brain function. Given the potential of dynamic functional connectivity to uncover brain states associated with Alzheimer's disease, it is interesting to ask: How does gene expression associated with Alzheimer's disease map onto the dynamic functional brain connectivity? If genetic variants associated with neurodegenerative processes involved in Alzheimer's disease are to be correlated with brain function, it is essential to generate such a map. Here, we investigate how the relation between gene expression in the brain and dynamic functional connectivity arises from nodal interactions, quantified by their role in network centrality (i.e. the drivers of the metastability), and the principal component of genetic co-expression across the brain. Our analyses include genetic variations associated with Alzheimer's disease and also genetic variants expressed within the cholinergic brain pathways. Our findings show that contrasts in metastability of functional networks between Alzheimer's and healthy individuals can in part be explained by the two combinations of genetic co-variations in the brain with the confidence interval between 72% and 92%. The highly central nodes, driving the brain aberrant metastable dynamics in Alzheimer's disease, highly correlate with the magnitude of variations from two combinations of genes expressed in the brain. These nodes include mainly the white matter, parietal and occipital brain regions, each of which (or their combinations) are involved in impaired cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, our results provide evidence of the role of genetic associations across brain regions in asymmetric changes in ageing. We validated our findings on the same cohort using alternative brain parcellation methods.

A plant-based diet has beneficial effects on the gut microbiota even when deficient in n-3 PUFAs. Human and animal studies show that increased intake of the n-3 PUFAs correlates with increased beneficial intestinal bacteria when compared to a Western diet.

The GNRs were functionalized with two peptides, Ang2 and D1, which conferred on them the properties of crossing the blood-brain barrier and binding to amyloid aggregates, respectively, thus making them a diagnostic tool with great potential for AD. The nanosystem was administered intravenously in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice of 4-, 8- and 18-months of age, and the accumulation of gold nanoparticles was observed by computed tomography (CT).

Our findings indicated that 18-month-old animals treated with our nanosystem (GNR-D1/Ang2) displayed noticeable differences in CT signals compared to those treated with a control nanosystem (GNR-Ang2). However, no such distinctions were observed in younger animals. This suggests that our nanosystem holds the potential to effectively detect AD pathology.

This study explored the effects of a circadian-effective lighting intervention on actigraphic sleep measures and subjective assessments of sleep disturbance, depression, and sleep-disturbed behaviors. Methods: Fourteen older adult (\u226560\u00a0years) participants (11 females, mean age = 84.1 [SD 8.9]), all diagnosed with moderate to severe dementia and sleep disturbance, were recruited from 3 assisted living and memory care facilities. Following a crossover, placebo-controlled design, 3 different lighting modes were used to deliver high levels of circadian stimulus to the participants' eyes for two 8-week intervention periods in a counter balanced order with a 4-week washout between the study's 2 conditions (dim light control vs. active intervention). Actigraphy and questionnaire data were collected over 7-day assessment periods that preceded (baseline weeks 1 and 9) and concluded (post-intervention week 9 and 22) the intervention periods. Actigraphic outcomes included sleep duration, sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep start time, and sleep end time. Subjective assessments included the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) instruments. Results: Under the active condition, sleep duration significantly (p = 0.018) increased and sleep start time significantly (p = 0.012) advanced after the intervention compared to baseline. Also under the active condition, PSQI (p = 0.012), CSDD (p = 0.007), Sleep Disorders Inventory frequency (p = 0.015), and SDI severity (p = 0.015) scores were significantly lower after the intervention compared to baseline.

        "AbstractText": "Functional connectivity between brain regions is known to be altered in Alzheimer's disease and promises to be a biomarker for early diagnosis. Several approaches for functional connectivity obtain an un-directed network representing stochastic associations (correlations) between brain regions. However, association does not necessarily imply causation. In contrast, Causal Functional Connectivity (CFC) is more informative, providing a directed network representing causal relationships between brain regions. In this paper, we obtained the causal functional connectome for the whole brain from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) recordings of subjects from three clinical groups: cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. We applied the recently developed Time-aware PC (TPC) algorithm to infer the causal functional connectome for the whole brain. TPC supports model-free estimation of whole brain CFC based on directed graphical modeling in a time series setting. We compared the CFC outcome of TPC with that of other related approaches in the literature. Then, we used the CFC outcomes of TPC and performed an exploratory analysis of the difference in strengths of CFC edges between Alzheimer's and cognitively normal groups, based on edge-wise p-values obtained by Welch's t-test. The brain regions thus identified are found to be in agreement with literature on brain regions impacted by Alzheimer's disease, published by researchers from clinical/medical institutions.",

Previous studies indicate that the frailty index, facial aging, telomere length (TL), and epigenetic aging clock acceleration are commonly used biological aging proxy indicators. This study aims to comprehensively explore potential relationships between biological aging and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors by integrating various biological aging proxy indicators, employing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Two-sample bidirectional MR analyses were conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Summary statistics for various neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, along with biological aging proxy indicators, were obtained from extensive meta-analyses of GWAS. Genetic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposures were used as instrumental variables, assessing causal relationships between three neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), two benign neurological tumors (vestibular schwannoma and meningioma), one malignant neurological tumor (glioma), and four biological aging indicators (frailty index, facial aging, TL, and epigenetic aging clock acceleration). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. Our analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer TL reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease but increases the risk of vestibular schwannoma and glioma (All Glioma, GBM, non-GBM). In addition, there is a suggestive causal relationship between some diseases (PD and GBM) and DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration. Causal relationships between biological aging proxy indicators and other neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors were not observed. Building upon prior investigations into the causal relationships between telomeres and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, our study validates these findings using larger GWAS data and demonstrates, for the first time, that Parkinson's disease and GBM may promote epigenetic age acceleration. Our research provides new insights and evidence into the causal relationships between biological aging and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most extensively researched neurodegenerative disorders due to its widespread prevalence and complex risk factors. Age is a crucial risk factor for AD, which can be estimated by the disparity between physiological age and estimated brain age. To model AD risk more effectively, integrating biological, genetic, and cognitive markers is essential. Here, we utilized mouse models expressing the major APOE human alleles and human nitric oxide synthase 2 to replicate genetic risk for AD and a humanized innate immune response. We estimated brain age employing a multivariate dataset that includes brain connectomes, APOE genotype, subject traits such as age and sex, and behavioral data. Our methodology used Feature Attention Graph Neural Networks (FAGNN) for integrating different data types. Behavioral data were processed with a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), subject traits with a 1D CNN, brain connectomes through a Graph Neural Network using quadrant attention module. The model yielded a mean absolute error for age prediction of 31.85 days, with a root mean squared error of 41.84 days, outperforming other, reduced models. In addition, FAGNN identified key brain connections involved in the aging process. The highest weights were assigned to the connections between cingulum and corpus callosum, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and piriform cortex. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting brain age in models of aging and genetic risk for AD. To verify the validity of our findings, we compared Fractional Anisotropy (FA) along the tracts of regions with the highest connectivity, the Return-to-Origin Probability (RTOP), Return-to-Plane Probability (RTPP), and Return-to-Axis Probability (RTAP), which showed significant differences between young, middle-aged, and old age groups. Younger mice exhibited higher FA, RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP compared to older groups in the selected connections, suggesting that degradation of white matter tracts plays a critical role in aging and for FAGNN's selections. Our analysis suggests a potential neuroprotective role of APOE2, relative to APOE3 and APOE4, where APOE2 appears to mitigate age-related changes. Our findings highlighted a complex interplay of genetics and brain aging in the context of AD risk modeling.",

        "AbstractText": "DNA breaks accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. While their role as true genomic lesions is recognized, DNA breaks also support cognitive function by facilitating the expression of activity-dependent immediate early genes (IEGs). This process involves TOP2B, a DNA topoisomerase that catalyzes the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). To characterize how AD impacts adaptive DNA breaks at nervous system genes. We leveraged the ability of DNA single- and double-strand breaks to activate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) that conjugate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to adjacent proteins. To characterize the genomic sites harboring DNA breaks in AD brains, nuclei extracted from 3 AD and 3 non-demented (ND) autopsy brains (frontal cortex, all male donors, age 78 to 91 years of age) were analyzed through CUT&RUN in which we targeted PAR with subsequent DNA sequencing. Although the AD brains contained 19.9 times more PAR peaks than the ND brains, PAR peaks at nervous system genes were profoundly lost in AD brains, and the expression of these genes was downregulated. This result is consistent with our previous CUT&RUN targeting \u03b3H2AX, which marks DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In addition, TOP2B expression was significantly decreased in the AD brains. Although AD brains contain a net increase in DNA breaks, adaptive DNA breaks at nervous system genes are lost in AD brains. This could potentially reflect diminished TOP2B expression and contribute to impaired neuron function and cognition in AD patients.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and gray matter volume analysis from structural MRI have emerged as valuable tools for investigating AD-related brain alterations. However, the potential benefits of integrating these modalities using deep learning techniques remain unexplored. In this study, we propose a novel framework that fuses composite images of multiple rs-fMRI networks (called voxelwise intensity projection) and gray matter segmentation images through a deep learning approach for improved AD classification. We demonstrate the superiority of fMRI networks over commonly used metrics such as amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF in capturing spatial maps critical for AD classification. We use a multi-channel convolutional neural network incorporating the AlexNet dropout architecture to effectively model spatial and temporal dependencies in the integrated data. Extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset of AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing improved classification performance of 94.12% test accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) score of 97.79 compared to existing methods. Our results show that the fusion results generally outperformed the unimodal results. The saliency visualizations also show significant differences in the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, caudate nucleus, and regions of basal ganglia which are in line with the previous neurobiological literature. Our research offers a novel method to enhance our grasp of AD pathology. By integrating data from various functional networks with structural MRI insights, we significantly improve diagnostic accuracy. This accuracy is further boosted by the effective visualization of this combined information. This lays the groundwork for further studies focused on providing a more accurate and personalized approach to AD diagnosis. The proposed framework and insights gained from fMRI networks provide a promising avenue for future research in deep multimodal fusion and neuroimaging analysis.",

In addition, nearly all Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD), and a large portion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) exhibit neuronal TDP-43 aggregation, leading to loss of nuclear function, but whether TDP-43 is similarly altered in human BBB ECs is unknown. Here we utilize a novel technique for the enrichment of endothelial and microglial nuclei from human cortical brain tissues, combined with inCITE-seq, to analyze nuclear proteins and RNA transcripts in a large cohort of healthy and diseased donors. Our findings reveal a unique transcriptional signature in nearly half of the capillary endothelial cells across neurodegenerative states, characterized by reduced levels of nuclear \u03b2-Catenin and canonical downstream genes, and an increase in TNF/NF-kB target genes. We demonstrate that this does not correlate with increased nuclear p65/NF-kB, but rather a specific loss of nuclear TDP-43 in these disease associated ECs. Comparative analysis in animal models with targeted disruption of TDP-43 shows that this is sufficient to drive these transcriptional alterations. This work reveals that TDP-43 is a critical governor of the transcriptional output from nuclear p65/NF-kB, which has paradoxical roles in barrier maintenance and also barrier compromising inflammatory responses, and suggests that disease specific loss in ECs contributes to BBB defects observed in the progression of AD, ALS and FTD.",

Proteome-wide examination of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using tandem mass tag and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry yielded 8,425 high-abundance proteins. We applied linear mixed-effect models to quantify residual cognitive change (cognitive resilience) of 5 cognitive abilities by regressing out cognitive decline related to age, sex, education, and indices of ADRD pathologies.

These criteria have been validated in symptomatic samples, with improved diagnostic yield. We set out to investigate the accuracy of the Boston criteria v2.0 for the diagnosis of CAA in a community-based sample. Participants were recruited from longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging conducted at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago: the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project.

The recently released Boston criteria v2.0 offered higher sensitivity (38.8%) and slightly lower specificity (83.5%).

In cases with probable CAA, the cortical location of microbleeds may represent a promising distinguishing feature between true-positive and false-positive cases. Despite its improved performance, the diagnostic sensitivity of the updated criteria in a community-based sample remains limited.

        "AbstractText": "We aimed to investigate the association between glycemic variability (GV) and neuroimaging markers of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), beta-amyloid (A\u03b2), brain atrophy, and cognitive impairment. This was a retrospective cohort study that included participants without dementia from a memory clinic. They all had A\u03b2 PET, brain MRI, and standardized neuropsychological tests and had fasting glucose (FG) levels tested more than twice during the study period. We defined GV as the intraindividual visit-to-visit variability in FG levels. Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression were used to identify whether GV was associated with the presence of severe WMH and A\u03b2 uptake with DM, mean FG levels, age, sex, hypertension, and presence of APOE4 allele as covariates. Mediation analyses were used to investigate the mediating effect of WMH and A\u03b2 uptake on the relationship between GV and brain atrophy and cognition. Among the 688 participants, the mean age was 72.2 years, and the proportion of female participants was 51.9%. Increase in GV was predictive of the presence of severe WMH (coefficient [95% CI] 1.032 [1.012-1.054]; p = 0.002) and increased A\u03b2 uptake (1.005 [1.001-1.008]; p = 0.007). Both WMH and increased A\u03b2 uptake partially mediated the relationship between GV and frontal-executive dysfunction (GV \u2192 WMH \u2192 frontal-executive; direct effect, -0.319 [-0.557 to -0.080]; indirect effect, -0.050 [-0.091 to -0.008]) and memory dysfunction (GV \u2192 A\u03b2 \u2192 memory; direct effect, -0.182 [-0.338 to -0.026]; indirect effect, -0.067 [-0.119 to -0.015]), respectively. In addition, increased A\u03b2 uptake completely mediated the relationship between GV and hippocampal volume (indirect effect, -1.091 [-2.078 to -0.103]) and partially mediated the relationship between GV and parietal thickness (direct effect, -0.00101 [-0.00185 to -0.00016]; indirect effect, -0.00016 [-0.00032 to -0.000002]). Our findings suggest that increased GV is related to vascular and Alzheimer risk factors and neurodegenerative markers, which in turn leads to subsequent cognitive impairment. Furthermore, GV can be considered a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia prevention.",

Recent approvals by the Food and Drug Administration have predominantly centered around individuals with prodromal and mild AD,1,2 signaling a shift toward early intervention. Despite the result of some recent trials,3 there is optimism and hope that treating individuals at preclinical stages could have even greater effects. A major challenge for the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of clinical trials on patients with preclinical AD, however, is the fact that cognitive and functional decline over time is mild. Previous studies have already shown the heterogeneity in sensitivity to longitudinal decline across cognitive tests within early disease stages.4,5.",

        "AbstractText": "It is unclear to what extent cognitive outcome measures are sensitive to capture decline in Alzheimer disease (AD) prevention trials. We aimed to analyze the sensitivity to changes over time of a range of neuropsychological tests in several cognitively unimpaired, biomarker-defined patient groups. Cognitively unimpaired individuals from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort and the SCIENCe project with available AD biomarkers, obtained from CSF, PET scans, and plasma at baseline, were followed over time (4.5 \u00b1 3.1 years, range 0.6-18.9 years). Based on common inclusion criteria for clinical trials, we defined groups (amyloid, phosphorylated tau [p-tau], APOE \u03b54). Linear mixed models, adjusted for age, sex, and education, were used to estimate change over time in neuropsychological tests, a functional outcome, and 2 cognitive composite measures. Standardized regression coefficients of time in years (\u03b2time) were reported as outcome of interest. We analyzed change over time with full follow-up, as well as with follow-up limited to 1.5 and 3 years. We included 387 individuals (aged 61.7 \u00b1 8.6 years; 44% female) in the following (partly overlapping) biomarker groups: APOE \u03b54 carriers (n = 212), amyloid-positive individuals (n = 109), amyloid-positive APOE \u03b54 carriers (n = 66), CSF p-tau-positive individuals (n = 127), plasma p-tau-positive individuals (n = 71), and amyloid and CSF p-tau-positive individuals (n = 50), or in a control group (normal biomarkers; n = 65). An executive functioning task showed most decline in all biomarker groups (\u03b2time range -0.30 to -0.71), followed by delayed word list recognition (\u03b2time range -0.18 to -0.50). Functional decline (\u03b2time range -0.17 to -0.63) was observed in all, except the CSF and plasma tau-positive groups. Both composites showed comparable amounts of change (\u03b2time range -0.12 to -0.62) in all groups, except plasma p-tau-positive individuals. When limiting original follow-up duration, many effects disappeared or even flipped direction. In conclusion, functional, composite, and neuropsychological outcome measures across all cognitive domains detect changes over time in various biomarker-defined groups, with changes being most evident among individuals with more AD pathology. AD prevention trials should use sufficiently long follow-up duration and/or more sensitive outcome measures to optimally capture subtle cognitive changes over time.",

        "AbstractText": "While the highest prevalence of dementia occurs in individuals older than 80 years, most imaging studies focused on younger populations. The rates of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation and the effect of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology on progression to dementia in this age group remain unexplored. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in A\u03b2 deposition over time and incident dementia in nondemented individuals followed during a period of 11 years. We examined 94 participants (age 85.9 + 2.8 years) who had up to 5 measurements of Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET and clinical evaluations from 2009 to 2020. All 94 participants had 2 PiB-PET scans, 76 participants had 3 PiB-PET scans, 18 participants had 4 PiB-PET scans, and 10 participants had 5 PiB-PET scans. The rates of A\u03b2 deposition were compared with 120 nondemented individuals younger than 80 years (69.3 \u00b1 5.4 years) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle (AIBL) study who had 3 or more annual PiB-PET assessments. By 2020, 49% of the participants developed dementia and 63% were deceased. There was a gradual increase in A\u03b2 deposition in all participants whether they were considered A\u03b2 positive or negative at baseline. In a Cox model controlled for age, sex, education level, APOE-4 allele, baseline Mini-Mental State Examination, and mortality, short-term change in A\u03b2 deposition was not significantly associated with incident dementia (HR 2.19 (0.41-11.73). However, baseline A\u03b2 burden, cortical thickness, and white matter lesions volume were the predictors of incident dementia. A\u03b2 accumulation was faster (p = 0.01) in the older cohort (5.6%/year) when compared with AIBL (4.1%/year). In addition, baseline A\u03b2 deposition was a predictor of short-term change (mean time 1.88 years). There was an accelerated A\u03b2 accumulation in cognitively normal individuals older than 80 years. Baseline A\u03b2 deposition was a determinant of incident dementia and short-term change in A\u03b2 deposition suggesting that an active A\u03b2 pathologic process was present when these participants were cognitively normal. Consequently, age may not be a limiting factor for the use of the emergent anti-A\u03b2 therapies.",

We evaluated biological correlates of WMH in former American football players, including markers of amyloid, tau, inflammation, axonal injury, neurodegeneration, and vascular health. Participants underwent clinical interviews, MRI, and lumbar puncture as part of the Diagnostics, Imaging, and Genetics Network for the Objective Study and Evaluation of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Research Project. Structural equation modeling tested direct and indirect effects between log-transformed total fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesion volumes (TLV) and the revised Framingham stroke risk profile (rFSRP), MRI-derived global metrics of cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy (FA), and CSF levels of amyloid \u03b21-42, p-tau181, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), and neurofilament light. Covariates included age, race, education, body mass index, APOE \u03b54 carrier status, and evaluation site. Models were performed separately for former football players and a control group of asymptomatic men unexposed to RHI. In 180 former football players (mean age = 57.2, 36% Black), higher log(TLV) had direct associations with the following: higher rFSRP score (B = 0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.40), higher p-tau181 (B = 0.17, 95% CI 0.01-0.43), lower FA (B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.13), and reduced cortical thickness (B = -0.25, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.08). In 60 asymptomatic unexposed men (mean age = 59.3, 40% Black), there were no direct effects on log(TLV) (rFSRP: B = -0.03, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.57; p-tau181: B = -0.30, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.37; FA: B = -0.07, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.42; or cortical thickness: B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.10). The former football players showed stronger associations between log(TLV) and rFSRP (1,069% difference in estimates), p-tau181 (158%), and FA (287%) than the unexposed men. Risk factors and biological correlates of WMH differed between former American football players and asymptomatic unexposed men. In addition to vascular health, p-tau181 and diffusion tensor imaging indices of white matter integrity showed stronger associations with WMH in the former football players.

Objective, quantitative clinical assessment tools are needed to track stability and delayed disease onset. Natural speech can serve as an accessible, cost-effective assessment tool. We aimed to identify early changes in the natural speech of FTD pathogenic variant carriers before they become symptomatic. In this cohort study, speech samples of picture descriptions were collected longitudinally from healthy participants in observational studies at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University between 2007 and 2020. Participants were asymptomatic but at risk for familial FTD. Status as \"carrier\" or \"noncarrier\" was based on screening for known pathogenic variants in the participant's family. Thirty previously validated digital speech measures derived from automatic speech processing pipelines were selected a priori based on previous studies in patients with FTD and compared between asymptomatic carriers and noncarriers cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A total of 105 participants, all asymptomatic, included 41 carriers: 12 men [30%], mean age 43 \u00b1 13 years; education, 16 \u00b1 2 years; MMSE 29 \u00b1 1; and 64 noncarriers: 27 men [42%]; mean age, 48 \u00b1 14 years; education, 15 \u00b1 3 years; MMSE 29 \u00b1 1. We identified 4 speech measures that differed between carriers and noncarriers at baseline: mean speech segment duration (mean difference -0.28 seconds, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.02, p = 0.04); word frequency (mean difference 0.07, 95% CI 0.008-0.14, p = 0.03); word ambiguity (mean difference 0.02, 95% CI 0.0008-0.05, p = 0.04); and interjection count per 100 words (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.07-0.59, p = 0.01). Three speech measures deteriorated over time in carriers only: particle count per 100 words per month (\u03b2 = -0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to -0.004, p = 0.009); total narrative production time in seconds per month (\u03b2 = -0.24, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.12, p < 0.001); and total number of words per month (\u03b2 = -0.48, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.19, p = 0.002) including in 3 carriers who later converted to symptomatic disease. Using automatic processing pipelines, we identified early changes in the natural speech of FTD pathogenic variant carriers in the presymptomatic stage. These findings highlight the potential utility of natural speech as a digital clinical outcome assessment tool in FTD, where objective and quantifiable measures for abnormal behavior and language are lacking.",

        "AbstractText": "Accumulating evidence suggests that gray matter atrophy, often considered a marker of Alzheimer disease (AD), can also result from cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a form of sporadic CSVD, diagnosed through neuroimaging criteria, that often co-occurs with AD pathology and leads to cognitive impairment. We sought to identify the role of hippocampal integrity in the development of cognitive impairment in a cohort of patients with possible and probable CAA. Patients were recruited from an ongoing CAA study at Massachusetts General Hospital. Composite scores defined performance in the cognitive domains of memory, language, executive function, and processing speed. Hippocampal subfields' volumes were measured from 3T MRI, using an automated method, and multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate their association with each cognitive domain and relationship to CAA-related neuroimaging markers. One hundred twenty patients, 36 with possible (age mean [range]: 75.6 [65.6-88.9]), 67 with probable CAA (75.9 [59.0-94.0]), and 17 controls without cognitive impairment and CSVD (72.4 [62.5-82.7]; 76.4% female patients), were included in this study. We found a positive association between all investigated hippocampal subfields and memory and language, whereas specific subfields accounted for executive function (CA4 [Estimate = 5.43; 95% CI 1.26-9.61; p = 0.020], subiculum [Estimate = 2.85; 95% CI 0.67-5.02; p = 0.022]), and processing speed (subiculum [Estimate = 1.99; 95% CI 0.13-3.85; p = 0.036]). These findings were independent of other CAA-related markers, which did not have an influence on cognition in this cohort. Peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), a measure of white matter integrity, was negatively associated with hippocampal subfields' volumes (CA3 [Estimate = -0.012; 95% CI -0.020 to -0.004; p = 0.034], CA4 [Estimate = -0.010; 95% CI -0.020 to -0.0007; p = 0.037], subiculum [Estimate = -0.019; 95% CI -0.042 to -0.0001; p = 0.003]). These results suggest that hippocampal integrity is an independent contributor to cognitive impairment in patients with CAA and that it might be related to loss of integrity in the white matter. Further studies exploring potential causes and directionality of the relationship between white matter and hippocampal integrity may be warranted.",

The identification of quantitative and reproducible markers of disease stratification in ALS is fundamental for study design definition and inclusion of homogenous patient cohorts into clinical trials. Our aim was to assess the rearrangements of structural and functional brain connectivity underlying the clinical stages of ALS, to suggest objective, reproducible measures provided by MRI connectomics mirroring disease staging. In this observational study, patients with ALS and healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical evaluation and brain MRI on a 3T scanner. Patients were classified into 4 groups, according to the King's staging system. Structural and functional brain connectivity matrices were obtained using diffusion tensor and resting-state fMRI data, respectively. Whole-brain network-based statistics (NBS) analysis and comparisons of intraregional and inter-regional connectivity values using analysis of covariance models were performed between groups. Correlations between MRI and clinical/cognitive measures were tested using Pearson coefficient. One hundred four patients with ALS and 61 age-matched and sex-matched HCs were included. NBS and regional connectivity analyses demonstrated a progressive decrease of intranetwork and internetwork structural connectivity of sensorimotor regions at increasing ALS stages in our cohort, compared with HCs. By contrast, functional connectivity showed divergent patterns between King's stages 3 (increase in basal ganglia and temporal circuits [p = 0.04 and p = 0.05, respectively]) and 4 (frontotemporal decrease [p = 0.03]), suggesting a complex interplay between opposite phenomena in late stages of the disease. Intraregional sensorimotor structural connectivity was correlated with ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-r) score (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and upper motor neuron burden (r = -0.25, p = 0.01). Inter-regional frontal-sensorimotor structural connectivity was also correlated with ALSFRS-r (r = 0.24, p = 0.02). No correlations with cognitive measures were found. MRI of the brain allows to demonstrate and quantify increasing disruption of structural connectivity involving the sensorimotor networks in ALS, mirroring disease stages. Frontotemporal functional disconnection seems to characterize only advanced disease phases. Our findings support the utility of MRI connectomics to stratify patients and stage brain pathology in ALS in a reproducible way, which may mirror clinical progression.",

In this cross-sectional study, disturbances in gait and balance, cognition, and urinary continence were assessed using clinical examination and self-report. MRI was evaluated for iNPH-specific imaging markers. iNPH was diagnosed according to International Guidelines (I.G.). Based on radiologic findings, participants were allocated to 1 of 4 groups: (A) Evans index (EI) \u22640.3 (reference), (B) EI >0.3 without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings, (C) radiologically probable iNPH according to I.G., and (D) radiologically holistically probable (h-probable) iNPH fulfilling radiologic criteria according to I.G. plus highly iNPH-specific changes according to an experienced neuroradiologist. The Gothenburg H70 Studies include 791 individuals (377 men, 414 women) born in 1944 who underwent brain MRI. The prevalence of iNPH was 1.5% (2.1% for men, 0.96% for women) according to I.G. Ninety participants (11%) had EI >0.3 without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings, 29 (3.7%) fulfilled the I.G. radiologic probable iNPH criteria alone, and 11 (1.4%) were classified as radiologically h-probable iNPH. Forty participants (5.1%) had I.G. radiologic features of iNPH (70% men vs 30% women, p = 0.005). Gait disturbances were more common in participants with EI >0.3 without other radiologic iNPH features (B) (33%) compared with the reference group (A) (19%) (p = 0.006).

The iNPH prevalence of 1.5% among 70-year-olds, which is considerably higher than earlier reported in this age group, suggests that iNPH may be more common than previously assumed. This is supported by the 5.1% total prevalence of imaging signs of iNPH. Ventriculomegaly without other iNPH-typical radiologic findings may be an early sign of developing iNPH in some patients.",

ARIA can take the form of vasogenic edema or sulcal effusion (ARIA-E) or haemosiderin deposition due to hemorrhage (ARIA-H).7 In vivo, ARIA is detected using MRI: ARIA-E is visible on fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequences; ARIA-H is best seen on iron-sensitive (T2* or susceptibility-weighted imaging) as microbleeds and/or superficial hemosiderin deposition. The pathophysiology of ARIA has yet to be fully determined but may result from antibody-mediated breakdown of amyloid plaques releasing A\u03b2 which is deposited in vessels leading to increased cerebral amyloid angiopathy or alterations in perivascular clearance or inflammation, possibly through complement activation.8.",

Patients with PPA and healthy controls were consecutively recruited at the Neurology Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute (Milan, Italy). Each participant underwent an RS 19-channel EEG. Using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, EEG current source densities were estimated at voxel level and compared among study groups. Using an RS functional MRI-driven model of source reconstruction, linear lagged connectivity (LLC) values within language and extra-language brain networks were obtained and analyzed among groups. Eighteen patients with logopenic PPA variant (lvPPA; mean age = 72.7 \u00b1 6.6; % female = 52.4), 21 patients with nonfluent/agrammatic PPA variant (nfvPPA; mean age = 71.7 \u00b1 8.1; % female = 66.6), and 9 patients with semantic PPA variant (svPPA; mean age = 65.0 \u00b1 6.9; % female = 44.4) were enrolled in the study, together with 21 matched healthy controls (mean age = 69.2 \u00b1 6.5; % female = 57.1). Patients with lvPPA showed a higher delta density than healthy controls (p < 0.01) and patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05) and svPPA (p < 0.05). Patients with lvPPA also displayed a greater theta density over the left posterior hemisphere (p < 0.01) and lower alpha2 values (p < 0.05) over the left frontotemporal regions than controls. Patients with nfvPPA showed a diffuse greater theta density than controls (p < 0.05). LLC was altered in all patients relative to controls (p < 0.05); the alteration was greater at slow frequency bands and within language networks than extra-language networks. Patients with lvPPA also showed greater LLC values at theta band than patients with nfvPPA (p < 0.05). EEG findings in patients with PPA suggest that lvPPA-related pathology is associated with a characteristic disruption of the cortical electrical activity, which might help in the differential diagnosis from svPPA and nfvPPA. EEG connectivity was disrupted in all PPA variants, with distinct findings in disease-specific PPA groups. This study provides Class IV evidence that EEG analysis can distinguish PPA due to probable Alzheimer disease from PPA due to probable FTD from normal aging.",

APOE \u03b54 carrier status has been shown to increase risk of ARIA in prior trials of aducanumab and other anti-amyloid therapies; however, the remainder of the human genome has not been evaluated for ARIA risk factors. Therefore, we sought to determine in a hypothesis-free manner whether genetic variants beyond APOE influence risk of ARIA in aducanumab-treated patients. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ARIA in participants in the ENGAGE and EMERGE trials.

No other genome-wide significant associations were found. We identified a strong, genome-wide significant association between APOE and risk of ARIA. Future, larger studies may be better powered to detect associations beyond APOE. These findings indicate that APOE is the strongest genetic risk factor of ARIA incidence, with implications for patient management and risk-benefit treatment decisions.

Our second objective was to compare NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum (S) with the routine neurodegeneration biomarkers used in AD, and to assess their concentrations relative to the degree of cognitive deficit. Samples from 124 healthy volunteers were used to estimate the S NfL RI. For the comparison study, we used CSF and S samples from 112 patients with cognitive disorders. Cognitive functions were assessed using the mini-mental state examination. ELISA assays were used to determine the CSF and S NfL levels, CSF \u03b2-amyloid peptide42 (A\u03b242), CSF \u03b2-amyloid peptide40 (A\u03b240), CSF total tau protein (tTau), CSF phosphorylated tau protein (pTau), and CSF alpha-synuclein (\u03b1S). The estimated RI of S NfL were 2.25-9.19 ng.L-1. The cut-off value of S NfL for assessing the degree of neuronal impairment was 10.5 ng.L-1. We found a moderate statistically significant correlation between S NfL and CSF A\u03b242 in the group with movement disorders, without dementia (rs = 0.631; p = 0.016); between S NfL and CSF A\u03b240 in the group with movement disorder plus dementia (rs = -0.750; p = 0.052); between S NfL and CSF tTau in the control group (rs = 0.689; p = 0.009); and between S NfL and CSF pTau in the control group (rs = 0.749; p = 0.003). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test revealed statistically significant differences between S NfL, CSF NfL, CSF A\u03b242, CSF tTau, and CSF pTau and diagnosis within groups. The highest kappa coefficients were found between the concentrations of S NfL and CSF NfL (\u03ba = 0.480) and between CSF NfL and CSF tTau (\u03ba = 0.351). Our results suggested that NfL and tTau in CSF of patients with cognitive decline could be replaced by the less-invasive determination of S NfL using a highly sensitive ELISA method. S NfL reflected the severity of cognitive deficits assessed by mini-mental state examination (MMSE). However, S NfL is not specific to AD and does not appear to be a suitable biomarker for early diagnosis of AD.",

We recruited very mild to mild VaD and AD patients who were age-matched among the first visitors to a dementia clinic. All subjects underwent a standardized clinical interview, physical and neurological examinations, and laboratory tests, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, according to the protocol of the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease assessment battery. A total of 105 pairs of VaD and AD patients participated in this study. Although the adjusted scores on Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination were similar between the two groups, the VaD patients performed better on the Boston Naming Test, Word List Memory, Word List Recall, Word List Recognition, and Constructional Recall Test. However, the scores on global CDR, CDR sum of boxes, and ADL-related CDR domains were higher in VaD patients than in AD patients (p<0.001). The VaD patients also showed poor performances on the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale, Frontal Assessment Battery, Executive Clock Drawing Task, and Stroop tests. Despite similar general cognitive function and better memory function, patients with VaD tend to be staged as severer dementia on the CDR scale than patients with AD because of more impaired ADL associated with executive dysfunction.",

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective properties of electroacupuncture in APP/PS1 mice with AD. A total of thirty APP/PS1 mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the Alzheimer's disease group (AD), the electroacupuncture treatment group (EA), and the ferroptosis inhibitor deferasirox treatment group (DFX). Additionally, ten C57BL/6 mice were included as a control group (Control). In the EA group, mice underwent flat needling at Baihui and Yintang, as well as point needling at Renzhong, once daily for 15\u00a0min each time. In the DFX group, mice received intraperitoneal injections of deferasirox at a dosage of 100\u00a0mg/kg/day. Following the 28-day treatment period, behavioral evaluation, morphological observation of neurons, and detection of neuronal ferroptosis were conducted. The electroacupuncture treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in spatial learning, memory ability, and neuronal damage in mice with AD. Analysis of neuronal ferroptosis markers indicated that electroacupuncture interventions reduced the elevated levels of malondialdehyde, iron, and ptgs2 expression, while also increasing superoxide dismutase activity, Ferroportin 1 and glutathione peroxidase 4 expression. Moreover, the regulatory impact of electroacupuncture on ferroptosis may be attributed to its ability to enhance the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2. This study suggested that electroacupuncture could inhibit the neuronal ferroptosis by activating the antioxidant function in neurons through p62/Keap1/Nrf2 signal pathway, thereby improve the cognitive function of AD mice by the neuronal protection effect.",

Hence, designing a selective DYRK1A inhibitor would result in a promising small molecule for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Developing selective inhibitors for DYRK1A has been a difficult challenge due to the highly preserved ATP-binding site of protein kinases. In this study, we employed a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) campaign targeting DYRK1A from a database containing 1.6 million compounds. Enzymatic assays were utilized to verify inhibitory properties, confirming that Y020-3945 and Y020-3957 showed inhibitory activity towards DYRK1A. In particular, the compounds exhibited high selectivity for DYRK1A over a panel of 120 kinases, reduced the phosphorylation of tau, and reversed the tubulin polymerization for microtubule stability. Additionally, treatment with the compounds significantly reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 activated by DYRK1A-assisted NFTs and A\u03b2 oligomers. These identified inhibitors possess promising therapeutic potential for conditions associated with DYRK1A in neurodegenerative diseases. The results showed that Y020-3945 and Y020-3957 demonstrated structural novelty compared to known DYRK1A inhibitors, making them a valuable addition to developing potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Consequently, in addition to graphene based 2D nanomaterials, 2D nanostructures designed using macromolecules (such as DNAs, proteins, peptides and peptoids), transition metal dichalcogenides, transition-metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXene), black phosphorous, chitosan, hexagonal boron nitrides, and graphitic carbon nitride, and covalent organic frameworks have been developed.

In this scenario, nanomaterial-based biosensors, or therapeutics especially 2D nanostructures are emerging to be promising in this regard.

The two others were the oldest and most severely affected, displayed normal values according the cut-off values. The cohort is too small to make any statistically significant correlation between the five p-NfL values with regard to disease severity. FRDA is less prevalent in our region of Sweden than could be assumed.

It is characterised by the sudden or sub-acute onset of symptoms affecting the shoulder and pelvic girdles, often accompanied by constitutional symptoms. Due to the lack of consensual diagnostic criteria and specific laboratory or radiological investigations for PMR, its diagnosis can be very challenging, particularly because it can be mimicked or masked by other geriatric syndromes. PMR responds well to glucocorticoid treatment, but if left untreated, can lead to morbidity and poor quality of life. We present the case of an 87-year-old male who presented with a one-week history of localised pain in the left hip joint, later involving the contralateral hip. Previously able to ambulate unaided, his mobility was now severely impaired. Due to his Alzheimer's dementia and multiple comorbid geriatric conditions, extensive investigations were undertaken before a diagnosis of atypical PMR was reached. Treatment with a low dose of prednisolone led to a full recovery. This case highlights the inconsistency between an atypical presentation and the classic presentation of PMR and draws attention to the possibility of missed diagnosis in older, frail patients. Atypical symptomatology on top of cognitive impairment and language barriers can be easily overlooked and left untreated and could lead to severe adverse outcomes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as PMR is readily diagnosed, but the treatment with glucocorticoids, though generally straightforward, can pose challenges, particularly when dealing with polypharmacy and multiple coexisting health conditions.",

AD screening could play an important role in individuals with at least one affected first-degree relative, but also without family history. As the demand for screening is rising worldwide, it is important to consider possible cross-cultural differences in attitudes toward pre-symptomatic screening in order to tailor healthcare services to the needs of each country. Objective: This study aims to investigate the attitudes of family members and non-family members of people with dementia toward pre-symptomatic screening and explore possible differences in attitudes across five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, Turkey) using translated versions of the \"Perceptions regarding pRE-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Screening\" questionnaire (PRE-ADS). Methods: The multicultural sample (N = 650) was recruited from samples that were previously used in validation studies of the translated PRE-ADS versions. The subscale \"Acceptability of Screening\", consisting of five PRE-ADS items to specifically explore willingness to undergo screening, was created. \u0399nternal consistency was measured, and structural validity was determined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Group comparisons were performed to investigate differences in attitudes toward pre-symptomatic AD screening regarding family history and country of origin using the PRE-ADS and the \"Acceptability of Screening\" mean scores. Results: Construct validity was acceptable for the PRE-ADS. Both the PRE-ADS (\u03b1 = 0.76) and its subscale \"Acceptability of Screening\" (\u03b1 = 0.90) had good internal consistency. Overall, 56.9% of the total sample expressed a positive intention toward pre-symptomatic AD screening. T-tests showed significantly higher mean scores of participants with an affected family member. An international comparison revealed differences in the \"Acceptability of Screening\" mean score across the five European countries. No cross-cultural differences were found for the PRE-ADS mean score after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusion: The PRE-ADS and its subscale are reliable tools for assessing pre-symptomatic AD screening attitudes.

        "AbstractText": "The Illinois Transplant Fund, established in 2015, provides private health insurance premium support for noncitizen patients with kidney failure in Illinois and thus allows them to qualify for kidney transplants. Our objective was to describe trends in kidney transplant volumes over time to inform the development of a hypothesis regarding the impact of the Illinois Transplant Fund on kidney transplant volumes for adult Hispanic patients with kidney failure in Illinois, especially noncitizen patients. Retrospective study. We used data on the annual number of kidney transplants and kidney failure prevalence aggregated to the national and state levels from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and United States Renal Data System, respectively. The annual number of transplants as a percentage of prevalent kidney failure cases among adults over time from 2010 to 2020 by race/ethnicity for all payer and private insurance-paid transplants and the annual number of transplants by citizenship status (for Hispanic patients only) were examined for the United States (US), Illinois, and 6 selected US states. Descriptive study. From pre- to post-Illinois Transplant Fund, the average annual number of transplants as a percentage of the average annual prevalent kidney failure cases for Hispanic adults increased by 4% in Illinois while the same figure increased by 33% for privately insured transplants. The observations reported in this paper cannot be interpreted as evidence for the program's impact. Observed trends suggest plausibility of developing a hypothesis that Illinois Transplant Fund's introduction may have contributed to improvement in kidney transplantation access for Hispanic patients in Illinois, especially noncitizens, but cannot constitute evidence in support of or against this hypothesis. Future research should test whether the Illinois Transplant Fund improved access to kidney transplants for noncitizens with kidney failure. Health policies regarding kidney transplant access for undocumented residents vary widely by state. The Illinois Transplant Fund (ITF) provides financial support for health insurance premiums, so undocumented patients with kidney failure in Illinois can qualify for a kidney transplant. In this study, we reported kidney transplant trends in Illinois before and after the creation of the ITF along with kidney transplant trends in the US overall and selected states that share similarities to Illinois.",

        "AbstractText": "Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome is a high-risk state for adverse health outcomes in older adults characterised by measured slow gait speed and self-reported cognitive complaints. The recent addition to the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 of robust dementia outcomes enabled us to assess the prognostic value of MCR for dementia and explore the various trajectories of participants diagnosed with MCR. We classified 680 community-dwelling participants free from dementia into non-MCR or MCR groups at mean [SD] age 76.3 [0.8] years. We used Cox and competing risk regression methods, adjusted for potential confounders, to evaluate the risk of developing all-cause incident dementia over 10 years of follow-up. Secondarily, we followed the trajectories for individuals with and without MCR at baseline and categorised them into subgroups based on whether MCR was still present at the next research wave, three years later. The presence of MCR increased the risk of incident dementia (adjusted HR 2.34, 95%CI 1.14-4.78, p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), as did fewer years of education and higher depression symptoms. However, MCR has a heterogenous progression trajectory. The MCR progression subgroups each have different prognostic values for incident dementia. MCR showed similar prognostic ability for dementia in a Scottish cohort as for other populations. MCR could identify a target group for early interventions of modifiable risk factors to prevent incident dementia. This study illustrates the heterogeneous nature of MCR progression. Exploring the underlying reasons will be important work in future work.",

        "ArticleTitle": "VEGF controls microglial phagocytic response to amyloid-\u03b2.",
        "AbstractText": "Microglial cells are well known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), due to the impaired clearance of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) protein. In AD, A\u03b2 accumulates in the brain parenchyma as soluble oligomers and protofibrils, and its aggregation process further give rise to amyloid plaques. Compelling evidence now indicate that A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2o) are the most toxic forms responsible for neuronal and synaptic alterations. Recently, we showed that the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) counteracts A\u03b2o-induced synaptic alterations and that a peptide derived from VEGF is able to inhibit A\u03b2 aggregation process. Moreover, VEGF has been reported to promote microglial chemotaxis to A\u03b2 brain deposits. We therefore investigated whether VEGF could influence microglial phagocytic response to A\u03b2, using in vitro and ex vivo models of amyloid accumulation. We report here that VEGF increases A\u03b2o phagocytosis by microglial cells and further characterized the molecular basis of the VEGF effect. VEGF is able to control \u03b1-secretase activity in microglial cells, resulting in the increased cleavage of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), a major microglial A\u03b2 receptor. Consistently, the soluble form sTREM2 also increases A\u03b2o phagocytosis by microglial cells. Taken together, these findings propose VEGF as a new regulator of A\u03b2 clearance and suggest its potential role in rescuing compromised microglial function in AD.",

It is demonstrated that the seeding activities of specific tau core fibrils are affected by the presence of pathogenic tau missense mutations and the microtubule binding domain composition of tau.

        "AbstractText": "The accumulation of neurofibrillary tau tangles, a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), occurs in medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions early in the disease process, with some of the earliest deposits localized to subregions of the entorhinal cortex. Although functional specialization of entorhinal cortex subregions has been reported, few studies have considered functional associations with localized tau accumulation. In this study, stepwise linear regressions were used to examine the contributions of regional tau burden in specific MTL subregions, as measured by 18F-MK6240 PET, to individual variability in cognition. Dependent measures of interest included the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and composite scores of delayed episodic memory and language. Other model variables included age, sex, education, APOE4 status, and global amyloid burden, indexed by 11C-PiB. Tau burden in right Brodmann area 35 (BA35), left and right Brodmann area 36 (BA36), and age each uniquely contributed to the proportion of explained variance in CDR-SB scores, while right BA36 and age were also significant predictors of MMSE scores, and right BA36 was significantly associated with delayed episodic memory performance. Tau burden in both left and right BA36, along with education, uniquely contributed to the proportion of explained variance in language composite scores. Importantly, the addition of more inclusive ROIs, encompassing less granular segmentation of the entorhinal cortex, did not significantly contribute to explained variance in cognition across any of the models. These findings suggest that the ability to quantify tau burden in more refined MTL subregions may better account for individual differences in cognition, which may improve the identification of non-demented older adults who are on a trajectory of decline due to AD.",

Multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT) quantified MWF in 3 a priori regions including the fornix, hippocampal cingulum (CgH), and cingulate cingulum (CgC). The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition assessed learning and delayed recall. Multiple linear regressions assessed for (1) interactions between age and sex on regional MWF and (2) associations of regional MWF and memory. (1) There was a significant age by sex interaction on MWF of the fornix (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and CgC (p\u2009=\u20090.005), but not the CgH (p\u2009=\u20090.192); as age increased, MWF decreased in women but not men.

Three-dimensional T1-weight images of a total of 227 participants were prospectively obtained from our institute from 2006 to 2022 to map gwBZ and gwBTV on images. Statistical analyses of gwBZ and gwBTV were performed to compare the three groups (AD, MCI, CN), to assess their correlations with age and Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and to evaluate their effects on AD classification in the hippocampus. This study included 62 CN participants (71.8 \u00b1 4.8 years, 20 males, 42 females), 72 MCI participants (72.6 \u00b1 5.1 years, 23 males, 49 females), and 93 AD participants (73.6 \u00b1 7.7 years, 22 males, 71 females).

Notably, 20 H3R isoforms are differentially expressed in the human brain as a consequence of alternative gene splicing. The hH3R-445, -415, -365 and -329 isoforms contain the prototypical GPCR (7TM) structure, yet exhibit deletions in the third intracellular loop, a structural domain that is pivotal for G protein-coupling, signaling and regulation. To date, the physiological relevance underlying the individual and combinatorial function of hH3R isoforms remains poorly understood. Nevertheless, given their significant implication in physiological processes (e.g. cognition, homeostasis) and neurological disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia), widespread targeting of hH3R isoforms by drugs may lead to on-target side effects in brain regions that are unaffected by disease. To this end, isoform- and/or pathway-selective targeting of hH3R isoforms by biased agonists could be of therapeutic relevance for the development of region- and disease-specific drugs. Hence, we have evaluated ligand biased signaling at the hH3R-445, -415, -365 and -329 isoforms across various G\u03b1i/o-mediated (i.e. [35S]GTP\u03b3S accumulation, cAMP inhibition, pERK1/2 activation, pAKT T308/S473 activation) and non G\u03b1i/o-mediated (i.e. \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment) endpoints that are relevant to neurological diseases. Our findings indicate that H3R agonists display significantly altered patterns in their degree of ligand bias, in a pathway- and isoform-dependent manner, underlining the significance to investigate GPCRs with multiple isoforms to improve development of selective drugs.

Since both INI and dulaglutide have beneficial effects on the cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we anticipate that improved CVD will underlie the hypothesized cognitive benefits. This 12-months trial will include 80 older adults aged >\u00a060 with MetS and MCI, randomized to 4 groups: INI/oral semaglutide, intranasal placebo/oral semaglutide, INI/oral placebo, and intranasal placebo/oral placebo. Feasibility of combining INI with semaglutide will be tested by examining the ease of use of INI (20IU, twice/day) with semaglutide (14 once daily), adherence, and safety profile are the efficacy of combination therapy on global cognition and neurobiological markers: cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose utilization, white matter hyperintensities, Alzheimer's related blood biomarkers and expression of insulin signaling proteins measured in brain-derived exosomes. Efficacy will be assessed for the intent-to-treat sample. This feasibility study is anticipated to provide the basis for a multi-center large-scale randomized clinical trial (RCT) of the cognitive benefits of the combination of INI with semaglutide in individuals enriched for CVD and at high dementia risk.",

        "AbstractText": "By safeguarding the neurological system, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) may have a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism and signaling route, however, remain unclear. This research aimed to investigate the impact of IGF-1 on AD as well as its possible mechanism and signaling route. In this work, intracerebroventricular AAV9-IGF-1 was delivered to APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Following therapy, the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were administered to evaluate spatial learning and memory. The elevated plus maze, the open field test, and the sucrose preference test were used to evaluate anxious-depressive-like behavior. Thioflavin S staining was employed to visualize A\u03b2 deposition, and ELISA was used to determine the quantities of soluble A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42. Transmission electron microscopy was used to view the mitochondrial structure and mitophagy vesicles. The protein expression levels of PINK1, Parkin, and LC3-II/LC3-I were finally determined by Western blotting. AAV9-IGF-1 therapy enhanced spatial learning and memory, relieved anxious-depressive-like behavior impairments, lowered amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, and decreased levels of soluble A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42. In addition, AAV9-IGF-1 therapy restored mitochondrial integrity and increased the number of mitophagy in transgenic mice expressing APP/PS1. These results indicate that IGF-1 is protective for APP/PS1 mice. The mechanism of the favorable benefits mediated by IGF-1 was connected to an increase in mitophagy, which might give a novel therapy target in the future.",

Trem2 is essential for microglia-mediated synaptic refinement, but whether Trem2 contributes to shaping neuronal development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Trem2 plays a key role in controlling the bioenergetic profile of pyramidal neurons during development. In the absence of Trem2, developing neurons in the hippocampal cornus ammonis (CA)1 but not in CA3 subfield displayed compromised energetic metabolism, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial mass and abnormal organelle ultrastructure. This was paralleled by the transcriptional rearrangement of hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth, with a pervasive alteration of metabolic, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial gene signatures, accompanied by a delay in the maturation of CA1 neurons. Our results unveil a role of Trem2 in controlling neuronal development by regulating the metabolic fitness of neurons in a region-specific manner.",

To examine how these factors alter neuroimmune function, we generated an integrative, longitudinal single-cell atlas of brain immune cells in AD model mice bearing the three common human APOE alleles. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses identified a reactive microglial population defined by the concomitant expression of inflammatory signals and cell-intrinsic stress markers whose frequency increased with age and APOE4 burden. An analogous population was detectable in the brains of human AD patients, including in the cortical tissue, using multiplexed spatial transcriptomics. This population, which we designate as terminally inflammatory microglia (TIM), exhibited defects in amyloid-\u03b2 clearance and altered cell-cell communication during aducanumab treatment. TIM may represent an exhausted-like state for inflammatory microglia in the AD milieu that contributes to AD risk and pathology in APOE4 carriers and the elderly, thus presenting a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

The aim if this study is to deepen into the concept of the heterogeneity of astrocyte subpopulations in the EC and in particular the identification of differentially functioning astrocyte subpopulations that respond differently to AD progression. S100\u03b2 protein belongs to group of small calcium regulators of cell membrane channels and pumps that are expressed by astrocytes and is hypothesised to play and have a relevant role in AD development. We analysed the selective differentiation of S100\u03b2-positive astrocytes into Glutamine synthetase (GS) and Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive sub-groups in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of AD triple transgenic animal model (3xTg-AD). EC is the brain region earliest affected in humans AD but also in this closest animal model regarding their pathology and time course. We observed no changes in the number of S100\u03b2-positive astrocytes between 1 and 18 months of age in the EC of 3xTg-AD mice. However, we identified relevant morphological changes in S100\u03b2/GFAP positive astrocytes showing a significant reduction in their surface and volume whilst an increase in number and percentage. Furthermore, the percentage of S100\u03b2/GS positive astrocyte population was also increased in 18 months old 3xTg-AD mice compared to the non-Tg mice. Our findings reveal the presence of differentially controlled astrocyte populations that respond differently to AD progression in the EC of 3xTg-AD mice. These results highpoints the major astrocytic role together with its early and marked affection in AD and arguing in favour of its importance in neurogenerative diseases and potential target for new therapeutic approaches.",

Likewise, several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurodegenerative biomarkers, including total tau (t-tau, a marker of neuronal body injury) and neurofilament light chain (NfL, a marker of axonal injury) show age-related increases in normal aging. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether the age-effect within different cognitive domains was mediated by age-associated CSF markers for neurodegenerative changes. We fitted 10 mediation models using structural equation modeling to investigate this in a cohort of 137 healthy adults, aged 40-80 years, from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation (DDI) study. Here, t-tau and NfL were defined as mediators between age and different cognitive tests. The models showed that NfL mediated the age-effect for CERAD learning and memory recall (learning: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.395, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; recall: \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.261, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Amyloid-\u03b2\u00a0(A\u03b2)(1-42) was administered by bilateral intracerebroventricular (icv) injection in the brain of adult male Wistar rats to experimentally develop AD. The cognitive impairment was assessed by measuring behavioral parameters such as Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in different rat brain regions. Inflammatory marker proteins such as cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B\u00a0(NF-\u041aB) (p65) were measured by the western blotting. Gene expression of ER stress downstream factors such as ATF-4, CHOP, and GADD-34 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Histological studies were performed to check A\u03b2 accumulation and neuronal degeneration. Integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) was used to confirm the specific role of ER stress-mediated inflammation in cognitive impairment. Administration of A\u03b2(1-42) resulted in alteration in levels of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory proteins, and mRNA levels of ER stress downstream factors. ISRIB treatment resulted in attenuation of A\u03b2(1-42)-induced ER stress, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment in rats. These results indicate that ER stress-mediated inflammation potentiates the cognitive impairment in AD.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related progressive neurodegenerative disease, and approximately 10% of AD cases are early-onset familial AD (EOFAD), which is mainly linked to point mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS1 and PS2). Mutations in PS2 are extremely rare and have not received enough attention. Recently, studies have found that Rho GTPase activity is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing in PS2 siRNA-transfected SH-SY5Y cells and found a group of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the regulation of GTPase activity. Among those DEGs, the most significantly downregulated was Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 5 (ARHGEF5). GTPase activity in PS2 siRNA-transfected cells was significantly decreased. Then, we found that the expression of ARHGEF5 and the GTPase activity of Mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (Miro2) in PS2 D439A mutant SH-SY5Y cells were significantly decreased. We found for the first time that PS2 can bind to Miro2, and the PS2 D439A mutation reduced the binding between PS2 and Miro2, reduced the expression of Miro2, and resulted in an imbalance in mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics. In conclusion, PS2 gene knockdown may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through the regulation of GTPase activity. The imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics mediated by the PS2 D439A mutation through regulation of the expression and GTPase activity of Miro2 may be a potential pathogenic mechanism of AD.",

Altered empathic mechanisms observed in AD may be a consequence of cognitive impairment, more specifically of reduced mental flexibility and self-regulation. The present study explored possible changes in empathy for subjects in the prodromal phase of AD, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD, and of their neural substrates. Eighteen MCI patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) questionnaire was administered to each participant. The IRI encompasses four factors: Perspective Taking; Fantasy; Empathic Concern; Personal Distress. MCI patients underwent a magnetic resonance imaging structural examination and were compared to 30 healthy controls (HC-MRI). A limited number of cortical and subcortical regions involved in social cognition was selected as regions of interest (ROIs). MCI individuals obtained lower scores than HC in the Perspective Taking and Fantasy subscales of the IRI, whereas they obtained higher scores on Empathic Concern.

The results of the present study suggest that a subtle impairment in regulatory mechanisms of empathy may occur very early during the course of AD, possibly as a consequence of neuropathological changes occurring in brain regions involved in social cognition.",

        "AbstractText": "Contrary to the long-held belief that the effects of vaccines are specific for the disease they were created; compelling evidence has demonstrated that vaccines can exert positive or deleterious non-specific effects (NSEs). In this review, we compiled research reports from the last 40\u00a0years, which were found based on the PubMed search for the epidemiological and immunological studies on the non-specific effects (NSEs) of the most common human vaccines. Analysis of information showed that live vaccines induce positive NSEs, whereas non-live vaccines induce several negative NSEs, including increased female mortality associated with enhanced susceptibility to other infectious diseases, especially in developing countries. These negative NSEs are determined by the vaccination sequence, the antigen concentration in vaccines, the type of vaccine used (live vs. non-live), and also by repeated vaccination. We do not recommend stopping using non-live vaccines, as they have demonstrated to protect against their target disease, so the suggestion is that their detrimental NSEs can be minimized simply by changing the current vaccination sequence. High IgG4 antibody levels generated in response to repeated inoculation with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be associated with a higher mortality rate from unrelated diseases and infections by suppressing the immune system. Since most COVID-19 vaccinated countries are reporting high percentages of excess mortality not directly attributable to deaths from such disease, the NSEs of mRNA vaccines on overall mortality should be studied in depth.",

Thus, the systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to explore the effect and potential mechanism of immunotherapy on AD animal experiments based on behavioral indicators. According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and the inclusion/exclusion criteria of immunotherapy in animal studies, 15 studies were systematically reviewed after extraction from a collected database of 3,742 publications.

After immunotherapy, the escape latency was reduced by 18.15 seconds and the number of crossings over the platform location was increased by 1.60 times in the Morris Water Maze. Furthermore, compared to the control group, active and passive immunization could markedly ameliorate learning and memory impairment in 3 \u00d7 Tg AD animal models, and active immunization could ameliorate the learning and memory ability of the APPswe/PS1\u0394E9 AD animal model.

In this study, we extracted blood biomarkers from large-scale transcriptomics to construct multiclass eXtreme Gradient Boosting models (XGBoost), and evaluated their performance in distinguishing AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Independent testing with external dataset revealed that the combination of blood transcriptomic signatures achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of 0.81 for multiclass classification (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.81; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.63), 0.83 for classification of AD vs. CN (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.72; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.73), and 0.85 for classification of AD vs. MCI (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a00.77; specificity\u00a0=\u00a00.73).

As the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is critical for episodic memory13,14,15,16 and is affected by \u03b2-amyloid accumulation in early AD,17,18,19,20,21 we address this question by performing Ca2+ imaging in RSC parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons during a contextual fear memory task in healthy control mice and the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that populations of PV interneurons responsive to aversive electric foot shocks during contextual fear conditioning (shock-responsive) significantly decreased in the 5XFAD mice, indicating dysfunctions in the recruitment of memory-encoding PV interneurons. In the control mice, ensemble activities of shock-responsive PV interneurons were selectively upregulated during the freezing epoch of the contextual fear memory retrieval, manifested by synaptic potentiation of PV interneuron-mediated inhibition. However, such changes in ensemble dynamics during memory retrieval and synaptic plasticity were both absent in the 5XFAD mice. Optogenetic silencing of PV interneurons during contextual fear conditioning in the control mice mimicked the memory deficits in the 5XFAD mice, while optogenetic activation of PV interneurons in the 5XFAD mice restored memory retrieval. These results demonstrate the critical roles of contextual fear memory-encoding PV interneurons for memory retrieval. Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction of PV interneurons may disrupt the recruitment of PV interneurons and their ensemble dynamics underlying contextual fear memory retrieval, subsequently leading to memory deficits in AD.",

Augmenting structural and functional neural plasticity by manipulating the Nogo signaling pathway is a novel promising strategy for treating brain ischemia and degenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease. In recent decades psychiatric research using experimental animals has focused on the attenuation of neural plasticity by stress loadings and on the enhanced resilience by psychopharmacological treatments.

To validate the effectiveness of the procedures, previously reported increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by ECS or ketamine administration and decrease of BDNF by stress loadings are also shown in the present study. Significant increases in hippocampal NgR1 and PirB expression were observed following chronic variable stress, and a significant increase in NgR1 expression was observed under a single prolonged stress paradigm. These results indicate a possible contribution of enhanced Nogo signaling to the attenuation of neural plasticity in response to stressful experiences.

However, the impact of AD on spoken discourse and the associated neuroanatomical correlates have mainly been studied in populations with higher levels of education, although preliminary evidence seems to indicate that socioeconomic status (SES) and level of education have an impact on spoken discourse. The purpose of this study was to analyze microstructural variables in spoken discourse in people with AD with low-to-middle SES and low level of education and to study their association with gray matter (GM) density. Nine women with AD and 10 matched (age, SES, and education) women without brain injury (WWBI) underwent a neuropsychological assessment, which included two spoken discourse tasks, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Microstructural variables were extracted from the discourse samples using NILC-Metrix software. Brain density, measured by voxel-based morphometry, was compared between groups and then correlated with the differentiating microstructural variables. The AD group produced a lower diversity of verbal time moods and fewer words and sentences than WWBI but a greater diversity of pronouns, prepositions, and lexical richness. At the neural level, the AD group presented a lower GM density bilaterally in the hippocampus, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the anterior cingulate gyrus. Number of words and sentences produced were associated with GM density in the left parahippocampal gyrus, whereas the diversity of verbal moods was associated with the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate gyrus bilaterally. The present findings are mainly consistent with previous studies conducted in groups with higher levels of SES and education, but they suggest that atrophy in the left inferior temporal gyrus could be critical in AD in populations with lower levels of SES and education. This research provides evidence on the importance of pursuing further studies including people with various SES and education levels. Spoken discourse has been shown to be affected in Alzheimer disease, but most studies have been conducted on individuals with middle-to-high SES and high educational levels.

Persons with dementia and their informal caregivers (ie, dyads) experience high rates of emotional distress and negative health outcomes. Several barriers prevent dyads from engaging in psychosocial care including cost, transportation, and a lack of treatments that target later stages of dementia and target the dyad together. Technologically informed treatment and serious gaming have been shown to be feasible and effective among persons living with dementia and their care partners. To increase access, there is a need for technologically informed psychosocial interventions which target the dyad, together in the home. This study aims to develop the toolkit for experiential well-being in dementia, a dyadic, \"bio-experiential\" intervention for persons with dementia and their caregivers. Per our conceptual model, the toolkit for experiential well-being in dementia platform aims to target sustained attention, positive emotions, and active engagement among dyads. In this paper, we outline the protocol and conceptual model for intervention development and partnership with design and development experts. We followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) stage model (stage 1A) and supplemented the model with principles of user-centered design. The first step includes understanding user needs, goals, and strengths. We met this step by engaging in methodology and definition synthesis and conducting focus groups with dementia care providers (N=10) and persons with dementia and caregivers (N=11). Step 2 includes developing and refining the prototype. We will meet this step by engaging dyads in up to 20 iterations of platform \u03b2 testing workshops. Step 3 includes observing user interactions with the prototype. We will meet this step by releasing the platform for feasibility testing. Key takeaways from the focus groups include balancing individualization and the dyadic relationship and avoiding confusing stimuli.

Our model consists of a coupled system of differential equations that delineates the dynamics of amyloid beta plaques, amyloid beta protein, tau protein, and astrocytes. Amyloid beta plaques can be considered fibrils that depend on both the plaque size and time. We change our mathematical model to a temporal system by applying an integration operation with respect to the plaque size. Theoretical analysis including existence, uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness is performed in our model. We extend our mathematical model by adding two populations, namely prion protein and amyloid beta-prion complex. We characterize the system dynamics by locating biologically feasible steady states and their local stability analysis for both models. The characterization of the proposed model can help inform in advancing our understanding of the development of Alzheimer's disease as well as its complicated dynamics. We investigate the global stability analysis around the interior equilibrium point by constructing a suitable Lyapunov function. We validate our theoretical analysis with the aid of extensive numerical illustrations.",

        "AbstractText": "Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a key rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. It is well known that PKM2 plays a vital role in the proliferation of tumor cells. However, PKM2 can also exert its biological functions by mediating multiple signaling pathways in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive dysfunction, ischemic stroke, post-stroke depression, cerebral small-vessel disease, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and autoimmune diseases. In these diseases, PKM2 can exert various biological functions, including regulation of glycolysis, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, proliferation of cells, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, or pathological autoimmune responses. Moreover, the complexity of PKM2's biological characteristics determines the diversity of its biological functions. However, the role of PKM2 is not entirely the same in different diseases or cells, which is related to its oligomerization, subcellular localization, and post-translational modifications. This article will focus on the biological characteristics of PKM2, the regulation of PKM2 expression, and the biological role of PKM2 in neurological diseases. With this review, we hope to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of PKM2, which may help researchers develop therapeutic strategies in clinic.",

Alzheimer's disease (AD) reigns as a prominent exemplar within this category, distinguished by its relentless progression of cognitive impairment and the accumulation of aberrant protein aggregates within the intricate landscape of the brain. While the intricate pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has been the subject of extensive investigation, recent scientific inquiry has unveiled a novel player in this complex scenario-transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) channels. This comprehensive review embarks on an exploration of the intricate interplay between TRPML1 channels and neurodegenerative diseases, with an explicit spotlight on Alzheimer's disease. It immerses itself in the intricate molecular mechanisms governing TRPML1 channel functionality and elucidates their profound implications for the well-being of neurons. Furthermore, the review ventures into the realm of therapeutic potential, pondering the possibilities and challenges associated with targeting TRPML1 channels as a promising avenue for the amelioration of neurodegenerative disorders. As we traverse this multifaceted terrain of neurodegeneration and the enigmatic role of TRPML1 channels, we embark on a journey that not only broadens our understanding of the intricate machinery governing neuronal health but also holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions in the relentless battle against neurodegenerative diseases.",

The variations of CSF NPTX2 across mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its association with brain metabolism remain elusive, albeit relevant for patient stratification and pathophysiological insights. We retrospectively analyzed 49 MCI-AD patients grouped by time until dementia (EMCI, n\u2009=\u200934 progressing within 2\u00a0years; LMCI, n\u2009=\u200915 progressing later/stable at follow-up). We analyzed demographic variables, cognitive status (MMSE score), and CSF NPTX2 levels using a commercial ELISA assay in EMCI, LMCI, and a control group of age-/sex-matched individuals with other non-dementing disorders (OND). Using [18F]FDG PET scans for voxel-based analysis, we explored correlations between regional brain metabolism metrics and CSF NPTX2 levels in MCI-AD patients, accounting for age. Baseline and follow-up MMSE scores were lower in LMCI than EMCI (p value\u2009=\u20090.006 and p\u2009<\u20090.001). EMCI exhibited significantly higher CSF NPTX2 values than both LMCI (p\u2009=\u20090.028) and OND (p\u2009=\u20090.006). We found a significant positive correlation between NPTX2 values and metabolism of bilateral precuneus in MCI-AD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.005 at voxel level, p\u2009<\u20090.05 with family-wise error correction at the cluster level). Higher CSF NPTX2 in EMCI compared to controls and LMCI suggests compensatory synaptic responses to initial AD pathology. Disease progression sees these mechanisms overwhelmed, lowering CSF NPTX2 approaching dementia. Positive CSF NPTX2 correlation with precuneus glucose metabolism links to AD-related metabolic changes across MCI course. These findings posit CSF NPTX2 as a promising biomarker for both AD staging and progression risk stratification.",

A retrospective cohort study consisting of all nursing home (NH) residents (\u226566\u2009years) with advanced dementia (Cognitive Function Scale score \u22652), a hospitalization between 2013-2017, and a Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0 assessment within 120\u2009days before hospitalization.

A multivariate logistic model clustering on hospital was used to examine the association of dysphagia with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube placement after adjustment for confounders. Between 2013 and 2017, 889,983 persons with NH stay with advanced dementia (mean age: 84.5, SD: 7.5, and 63.5% female) were hospitalized.

        "AbstractText": "Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a significant and highly prevalent symptom, whose mechanisms are poorly understood. The third Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable paper on PSF focussed primarily on defining and measuring PSF while mechanisms were briefly discussed. This companion paper to the main paper is aimed at elaborating possible mechanisms of PSF. This paper reviews the available evidence that potentially explains the pathophysiology of PSF and draws parallels from fatigue literature in other conditions. We start by proposing a case for phenotyping PSF based on structural, functional, and behavioral characteristics of PSF. This is followed by discussion of a potentially significant role of early inflammation in the development of fatigue, specifically the impact of low-grade inflammation and its long-term systemic effects resulting in PSF. Of the many neurotransmitter systems in the brain, the dopaminergic systems have the most evidence for a role in PSF, along with a role in sensorimotor processing. Sensorimotor neural network dynamics are compromised as highlighted by evidence from both neurostimulation and neuromodulation studies. The double-edged sword effect of exercise on PSF provides further insight into how PSF might emerge and the importance of carefully titrating interventional paradigms. The paper concludes by synthesizing the presented evidence into a unifying model of fatigue which distinguishes between factors that pre-dispose, precipitate, and perpetuate PSF. This framework will help guide new research into the biological mechanisms of PSF which is a necessary prerequisite for developing treatments to mitigate the debilitating effects of post-stroke fatigue.",

We describe a case series of PRES with hemorrhagic features. Subjects and methods Electronic medical records of hospitalized patients diagnosed with PRES from January 2009 to December 2021 were collected. Demographic data, medical history, clinical presentation, and outcome were recorded. Variables were compared between patients with and without hemorrhagic features using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test with a statistical significance level of p<0.05. Results Over a 12-year period, 33 patients were diagnosed with PRES, of whom 10 had hemorrhagic features: seven cortical microbleeds, two intraparenchymal hematomas, and one subarachnoid hemorrhage. Half of the patients were women, with a median age of 45.8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 21.8), and were admitted for non-neurological reasons. The sample included nine transplant recipients (six solid organa, three bone marrowa), with four patients in the immediate post-transplant period. PRES occurred in the context of infections and blood pressure fluctuations under cytotoxic drugs, such as immunosuppressants. Seventy percent showed improvement/resolution on neuroimaging at a median of 70 days (IQR 62.9). The three major hemorrhages occurred in the context of thrombocytopenia. The recorded in-hospital mortality was 10%. When compared to PRES without hemorrhagic features, patients with hemorrhagic features had a lower use of corticosteroids (50% vs. 78.8%; p=0.02) and a higher presence of restrictive lesions on neuroimaging (60% vs. 17%; p=0.04), with no differences in the other analyzed variables. Conclusion Patients with PRES and hemorrhagic features had a lower use of corticosteroids and a higher presence of restrictive lesions on neuroimaging.

The treatment approaches included AChEIs, memantine, and combination therapy, with variations in the starting time for these treatments based on the dementia type. The use of AChEIs and memantine showed efficacy in improving cognitive function and overall function in individuals with MCI, AD, and non-AD dementias. Combination therapy EGb761 like Gingko extract with AChEIs and/or Memantine demonstrated a slower progression compared to AChEIs alone in individuals with prodromal dementia (MCI) and AD. The starting time for memantine and combination therapy was earlier in non-AD dementia cases compared to AD dementia cases and prodromal dementia.

Taurine and homotaurine (HT) are naturally occurring sulfonate amino acids, with taurine being highly abundant in animal tissues, but declining with age in the blood. HT is a blood-brain barrier permeable drug under investigation for Alzheimer's disease. HT also has beneficial effects in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis likely through an anti-inflammatory mechanism mediated by GABAA receptor (GABAAR) agonism in immune cells. While both taurine and HT are structural GABA analogs and thought to be GABA mimetics at GABAARs, there is uncertainty concerning their potency as GABA mimetics on native GABAARs. We show that HT is a very potent GABA mimetic, as it evokes GABAAR-mediated currents with an EC50 of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM (vs. 3.7\u00a0\u03bcM for GABA and 116\u00a0\u00b5M for taurine) in murine cerebellar granule cells in brain slices, with both taurine and HT having similar efficacy in activating native GABAARs. Furthermore, HT displaces the high affinity GABAAR ligand [3H]muscimol at similarly low concentrations (HT IC50 of 0.16\u00a0\u03bcM vs. 125\u00a0\u03bcM for taurine) in mouse brain homogenates. The potency of taurine and HT as GABAAR agonists aligns with endogenous concentrations of taurine in the blood and with HT concentrations achieved in the brain following oral administration of HT or the HT pro-drug ALZ-801. Consequently, we discuss that GABAARs subtypes, similar to the ones we studied here in neurons, are plausible targets for mediating the potential beneficial effects of taurine in health and life-span extension and the beneficial HT effects in dementia and autoimmune conditions.",

However, the clinical benefits of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients still need to be evaluated. This study examined the role of tDCS in improving cognition and whether the improved cognition is related to altered cortical plasticity. 124 patients with AD were randomly assigned to active tDCS (n=63) or sham tDCS (n=61). The tDCS was applied at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 30 treatment sessions across 6 weeks (5\u2009days per week, 2\u2009days off). The Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) were used for cognition evaluation at baseline, week 2 and week 6. The cortical plasticity was represented by motor-evoked potential (MEP) measured with an electromyogram. The results showed that multiple courses of active tDCS can improve the cognitive functions of patients with AD, especially in the memory domain (word recall, recall of test instructions and word recognition). In addition, the damaged MEP level was enhanced following active treatment. In the active tDCS group, the improvements in ADAS-Cog total and subitem (word recall and word recognition) scores were negatively correlated with the enhancement of MEP. Our research indicates for the first time that twice-a-day tDCS may improve the cognitive function of patients with AD. This study also suggests that cognitive dysfunction may be related to impaired cortical plasticity, which warrants mechanistic investigations of the relationship between cognition and plasticity in the future.

        "AbstractText": "Stem cells are a promising therapeutic in Alzheimer's disease (AD) given the complex pathophysiologic pathways involved. However, the therapeutic mechanisms of stem cells remain unclear. Here, we used spatial transcriptomics to elucidate therapeutic mechanisms of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in an animal model of AD. hNSCs were transplanted into the fimbria fornix of the hippocampus using the 5XFAD mouse model. Spatial memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Amyloid plaque burden was quantified. Spatial transcriptomics was performed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified both globally and within the hippocampus. Subsequent pathway enrichment and ligand-receptor network analysis was performed. hNSC transplantation restored learning curves of 5XFAD mice. However, there were no changes in amyloid plaque burden. Spatial transcriptomics showed 1,061 DEGs normalized in hippocampal subregions. Plaque induced genes in microglia, along with populations of stage 1 and stage 2 disease associated microglia (DAM), were normalized upon hNSC transplantation. Pathologic signaling between hippocampus and DAM was also restored. hNSCs normalized many dysregulated genes, although this was not mediated by a change in amyloid plaque levels. Rather, hNSCs appear to exert beneficial effects in part by modulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and signaling in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Previous studies have linked childhood adversities to dementia risk, yet most studies are cross-sectional in design and utilize retrospective self-reports to assess childhood experiences. These design characteristics make it difficult to establish temporal order and draw firm conclusions. Using a longitudinal design, we sought to determine whether childhood maltreatment predicts dementia risk factors in middle adulthood. Data have been obtained from a prospective cohort design study of children with documented cases of childhood maltreatment (ages 0-11 years at case identification) and demographically matched controls who were followed up and interviewed in middle adulthood. Outcomes were assessed through a medical examination and interview, and 807 of the cases that included blood collection at mean age 41. Dementia risk were investigated using 11 potentially modifiable risk factors. Compared to controls, individuals with histories of childhood maltreatment had a higher risk of low educational attainment, low social contact, smoking, and clinical depression, and a higher total number of dementia risk factors. In general, childhood maltreatment predicted a higher risk of dementia for females, males, and Black and White participants. Black maltreated participants had a greater risk for traumatic brain injury compared to Black controls. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect, each predicted a higher number of dementia risk factors in mid-life. These findings provide evidence that childhood maltreatment increases the risk for dementia in mid-life and has a demonstrable impact lasting over 30 years. Reducing the prevalence of mid-life dementia risk factors could reduce the risk of later-life dementia.",

Vietnam is an understudied country, and little is known regarding the overall unmet needs of caregivers or the demographic risk factors associated with unmet caregiving needs. This study aimed to determine the burden of unmet care needs of community-dwelling PLWD and identify sociodemographic risks associated with unmet care needs. A cross-sectional study in a rural area facing urbanisation in Hanoi, Vietnam recruited PWLD-caregiver dyads with multistage sampling. We utilised the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) instrument to evaluate care needs across four domains. Caregivers rated PLWD needs, with higher scores indicating greater unmet needs. The Mann-Whitney test was employed for comparing two groups, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparisons involving more than two groups in the analysis, and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Among 90 PLWD participating in the study, the overall mean care needs score was 11.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3, with only 16.2% of PLWD having their care needs met. Environmental and physical needs were more frequently met than psychological or social needs. Only 48.0% and 43.9% of environmental and physical needs were met respectively, and a meagre 20.9% and 23.6% for psychological and social needs. Unmet care needs were more frequent for PWLD who were female, single or divorced, had lower monthly household income, or who were in more advanced stages of dementia, as indicated by Clinical Dementia Rating scores \u22651. Unmet needs for PWLD are common. Increased caregiver education, resources, and services in Vietnam are urgently required to improve the quality of life for this population.",

The everted rat sac model and a Caco-2 paracellular absorption monolayer model were used, indicating that QMDDQ has a good absorption capacity with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) > 1 \u00d7 10-6 cm/s and the absorption of QMDDQ was concentration-dependent. When the concentration of QMDDQ was 1 mM and the transport time was 180 min, the highest absorption concentration of QMDDQ was 41.17 \u00b1 3.48 \u03bcM (P < 0.05). The myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK)-specific inhibitor ML-7 and activator MPA, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence results showed that QMDDQ absorption takes place by mediating the MLCK-p-MLCK-MLC signaling pathway, reversibly opening the zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin in tight junctions (TJs), upregulating claudin-2 expression, and reaching targets through blood to inhibit neuronal overactivity. Results of fluorescence imaging in vivo verified that QMDDQ could enter the brain 4 h after oral administration. The results provide a theoretical foundation for the mechanism of paracellular absorption of active peptides and a starting point for the development of functional foods for Alzheimer's disease intervention.",

This increasing trend, along with an inability to develop BBB permeating drugs, is presenting a major hurdle in the treatment of CNS-related disorders, like dementia. To overcome this, it is necessary to understand the structure and function of the BBB, including the transport of molecules across its interface in both healthy and pathological conditions. The use of CNS drug carriers is rapidly gaining popularity in CNS research due to their ability to target BBB transport systems. Further research and development of drug delivery vehicles could provide essential information that can be used to develop novel treatments for neurological conditions.

To understand and prevent disease-specific mechanisms of filament formation, in vitro models for aggregation that robustly yield these different end point structures will be necessary. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to reconstruct fibril polymorphs taken on by residues 297-391 of tau under conditions previously shown to give rise to the core structure found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While we were able to reconstitute the AD tau core fold, the proportion of these paired helical filaments (PHFs) was highly variable, and a majority of filaments were composed of PHFs with an additional identical C-shaped protofilament attached near the PHF interface, termed triple helical filaments (THFs). Since the impact of filament layer quaternary structure on the biological properties of tau and other amyloid filaments is not known, the applications for samples of this morphology are presently uncertain. We further demonstrate the variation in the proportion of PHFs and PHF-like fibrils compared to other morphologies as a function of shaking time and AD polymorph-favoring cofactor concentration. This variation in polymorph abundance, even under identical experimental conditions, highlights the variation that can arise both within a lab and in different laboratory settings when reconstituting specific fibril polymorphs in vitro.",

        "AbstractText": "Phosphodiesterase 2\u00a0A (PDE2A) is an enzyme involved in the homeostasis of cAMP and cGMP and is the most highly expressed PDE in human brain regions critical for socio-cognitive behavior. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, PDE2A expression level is upregulated in Fmr1-KO mice, a model of the Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Indeed, PDE2A translation is negatively modulated by FMRP, whose functional absence causes FXS. While the pharmacological inhibition of PDE2A has been associated to its pro-cognitive role in normal animals and in models of ID and ASD, homozygous PDE2A mutations have been identified in patients affected by ID, ASD and epilepsy. To clarify this apparent paradox about the role of PDE2A in brain development, we characterized here Pde2a+/- mice (homozygote animals being not viable) at the behavioral, cellular, molecular and electrophysiological levels. Pde2a+/- females display a milder form of the disorder with reduced cognitive performance in adulthood, conversely males show severe socio-cognitive deficits throughout their life. In males, these phenotypes are associated with microglia activation, elevated glutathione levels and increased externalization of Glutamate receptor (GluR1) in CA1, producing reduced mGluR-dependent Long-term Depression. Overall, our results reveal molecular targets of the PDE2A-dependent pathway underlying socio-cognitive performance. These results clarify the mechanism of action of pro-cognitive drugs based on PDE2A inactivation, which have been shown to be promising therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, FXS as well as other forms of ASD.",

And the consistency of this relationship across different OAC classes and dementia subtypes is still uncertain. To comprehensively evaluate this association, we applied Mendelian randomization (MR) combined with pharmacovigilance analysis. MR was used to assess the associations between genetic proxies for three target genes of OACs (VKORC1, F2, and F10) and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD). This genetic analysis was supplemented with real-world pharmacovigilance data, employing disproportionality analysis for more reliable causal inference. Increased expression of the VKORC1 gene was strongly associated with increased risk of dementia, especially for AD (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.28, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.14-1.43; p value\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Additional sensitivity analyses, including different MR models and cohorts, supported these results. Conversely, no strong causal associations of genetically proxied F2 and F10 target genes with dementia and its subtypes were found. This study reveals that the inhibition of genetically proxied VKORC1 expression or VKAs exposure is associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's dementia.

The consequences of AD/ADRD can be challenging for patients, their families, and caregivers. There is a significant increase in the burden of illness, primarily affecting Hispanic/Latino families. This is partly due to their strong sense of duty towards family, and it is exacerbated by the inadequacy of healthcare and community services that are culturally and linguistically suitable and responsive to their needs.

This prospective observational study enrolled 29 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 21 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia from the Departments of Psychiatry at Osaka University Hospital and Asakayama General Hospital and the Brain Function Centre at Nippon Life Hospital. CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD, CDR\u00ae, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Western Aphasia Battery (WAB), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-plus (NPI-plus), Stereotypy Rating Inventory (SRI), and frontal behavioural symptom scores obtained from items of NPI-plus and SRI, were conducted to assess inter- and intra-rater reliability, validity, and responsiveness. We performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the discriminating power of the Behaviour/Comportment/Personality (BEHAV) and Language (LANG) domains of the CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD and the MEMORY domain of the CDR\u00ae in patients AD dementia and FTD. The CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD showed good inter- and intra-rater reliabilities. In patients with FTD, the BEHAV domain of the CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD was significantly correlated with all clinical measures except for the SRI total score, while the LANG domain of the CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD was significantly correlated with the MMSE and the WAB-Aphasia quotient. In addition, the CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD sum of boxes significantly changed after 6\u2009months and after 1\u2009year. ROC curve analysis showed that the BEHAV and LANG domains of the CDR\u00ae plus NACC FTLD distinguished between patients with AD dementia and FTD better than the MEMORY domain of the CDR\u00ae.

        "ArticleTitle": "[Study on effects of 40 Hz light flicker stimulation on spatial working memory in rats and its neural mechanism].",
        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive impairment, with the predominant clinical diagnosis of spatial working memory (SWM) deficiency, which seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients. However, the current pharmacological therapies have unsatisfactory cure rates and other problems, so non-pharmacological physical therapies have gradually received widespread attention. Recently, a novel treatment using 40 Hz light flicker stimulation (40 Hz-LFS) to rescue the cognitive function of model animals with AD has made initial progress, but the neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, this paper will explore the potential neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of SWM by 40 Hz-LFS based on cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Ten adult Wistar rats were first subjected to acute LFS at frequencies of 20, 40, and 60 Hz. The entrainment effect of LFS with different frequency on neural oscillations in the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was analyzed. The results showed that acute 40 Hz-LFS was able to develop strong entrainment and significantly modulate the oscillation power of the low-frequency gamma (l\u03b3) rhythms. The rats were then randomly divided into experimental and control groups of 5 rats each for a long-term 40 Hz-LFS (7 d). Their SWM function was assessed by a T-maze task, and the CFC changes in the HPC-mPFC circuit were analyzed by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). The results showed that the behavioral performance of the experimental group was improved and the PAC of \u03b8-l\u03b3 rhythm was enhanced, and the difference was statistically significant. The results of this paper suggested that the long-term 40 Hz-LFS effectively improved SWM function in rats, which may be attributed to its enhanced communication of different rhythmic oscillations in the relevant neural circuits. It is expected that the study in this paper will build a foundation for further research on the mechanism of 40 Hz-LFS to improve cognitive function and promote its clinical application in the future.",

Polyphenolic chemicals, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, are involved in the neuroprotective pathway. Because of their nutritional value, nuts have been shown in recent research to be helpful in neuroprotection. Hazelnut is often consumed worldwide in various items, including processed foods, particularly in bakery, chocolate, and confectionery products. This nut is an excellent source of vitamins, amino acids, tocopherols, phytosterols, polyphenols, minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids. Consuming hazelnut may attenuate the risk of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington's disease due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant qualities. Many documents introduce hazelnut as an excellent choice to provide neuroprotection against neurodegenerative disorders and there is some direct proof of its neuroprotective effects. So hazelnut consumption in daily diet may reduce neurodegenerative disease risk and be advantageous in reducing the imposed costs of dealing with neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multi-Domain Interventions for Dementia Prevention - A Systematic Review.",
        "AbstractText": "There is a growing incidence of cognitive decline and dementia associated with the ageing population. Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and cognitive activities may individually or collectively be undertaken to increase one's odds of preventing cognitive decline and future dementia. This study will examine whether clinical trials using multidomain lifestyle intervention can significantly decrease the risk of cognitive decline and therefore dementia. This systematic literature review of multidomain lifestyle interventions for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia followed the PRISMA guidelines. Clinical trials involving multidomain intervention (i.e., diet and physical activity, or without cognitive training) in older adults (\u2265 49 years old) at higher risk of dementia were identified through 5 electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Scopus). A comprehensive search was performed to identify and retrieve publications until 15 November 2022. Trials were published in English. The included studies (n=15) assessed change in cognition in response to a multidomain lifestyle intervention. However, the cognitive outcome measures used in these studies were heterogeneous. Despite this heterogeneity, two thirds of the studies showed improvement in cognition following a multidomain intervention (n=10 with a total of 9,439 participants). However, five studies reported no improvement in cognition following the multidomain intervention. The most common form of dietary intervention included higher amount of fruit and vegetable intake; whole-grain cereal products instead of refined; low fat options in milk and meat products; and limiting sucrose intake to less than 50 g/day. Most clinical trial studies were powered to examining the effects of multidomain interventions in cognition but were not designed to test the contribution of individual domains (i.e., dietary changes, increased physical activity, or increased cognitive stimulation alone). This systematic review aimed to determine the effect of multimodal lifestyle interventions on cognitive outcomes in older adults at risk of dementia. We found that participants with conditions that may increase the risk of dementia, (e.g., hypertension, cardiovascular fragility) do benefit from multi-modal lifestyle changes including diet, physical activity, and cognitive training. Two thirds of studies using multidomain lifestyle interventions showed improvements in cognitive function. Trials with a focus on cognitive training, dietary improvement, and physical activity may prevent or delay cognitive decline in older adults including those at risk of developing dementia. Future studies should consider longer follow-up periods and adequate power to be able to examine the effects of each lifestyle component in the context of multimodal interventions.",

        "AbstractText": "It is documented that low protein and amino-acid dietary intake is related to poorer cognitive health and increased risk of dementia. Degradation of the neuromodulatory pathways, (comprising the cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems) is observed in neurodegenerative diseases and impairs the proper biosynthesis of key neuromodulators from micro-nutrients and amino acids. How these micro-nutrients are linked to neuromodulatory pathways in healthy adults is less studied. The Locus Coeruleus-Noradrenergic System (LC-NA) is the earliest subcortical structure affected in Alzheimer's disease, showing marked neurodegeneration, but is also sensitive for age-related changes. The LC-NA system is critical for supporting attention and cognitive control, functions that are enhanced both by tyrosine administration and chronic tyrosine intake. The purpose of this study was to 1) investigate whether the dietary intake of tyrosine, the key precursor for noradrenaline (NA), is related to LC signal intensity 2) whether LC mediates the reported association between tyrosine intake and higher cognitive performance (measured with Trail Making Test - TMT), and 3) whether LC signal intensity relates to an objective measure of brain maintenance (BrainPAD). The analyses included 398 3T MRIs of healthy participants from the Berlin Aging Study II to investigate the relationship between LC signal intensity and habitual dietary tyrosine intake-daily average (HD-Tyr-IDA - measured with Food Frequency Questionnaire - FFQ). As a control procedure, the same analyses were repeated on other main seeds of the neuromodulators' subcortical system (Dorsal and Medial Raphe, Ventral Tegmental Area and Nucleus Basalis of Meynert). In the same way, the relationships between the five nuclei and BrainPAD were tested. Results show that HD-Tyr-IDA is positively associated with LC signal intensity. Similarly, LC disproportionally relates to better brain maintenance (BrainPAD). Mediation analyses reveal that only LC, relative to the other nuclei tested, mediates the relationship between HD-Tyr-IDA I and performance in the TMT and between HD-Tyr-IDA and BrainPAD. These findings provide the first evidence linking tyrosine intake with LC-NA system signal intensity and its correlation with neuropsychological performance. This study strengthens the role of diet for maintaining brain and cognitive health and supports the noradrenergic theory of cognitive reserve. Within this framework, adequate tyrosine intake might increase the resilience of LC-NA system functioning, by preventing degeneration and supporting noradrenergic metabolism required for LC function and neuropsychological performance.",

        "AbstractText": "Real-world monitoring using wearable sensors has enormous potential for assessing disease severity and symptoms among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD). Many distinct features can be extracted, reflecting multiple mobility domains. However, it is unclear which digital measures are related to PD severity and are sensitive to disease progression. The aim was to identify real-world mobility measures that reflect PD severity and show discriminant ability and sensitivity to disease progression, compared to the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scale. Multicenter real-world continuous (24/7) digital mobility data from 587 persons with PD and 68 matched healthy controls were collected using an accelerometer adhered to the lower back. Machine learning feature selection and regression algorithms evaluated associations of the digital measures using the MDS-UPDRS (I-III). Binary logistic regression assessed discriminatory value using controls, and longitudinal observational data from a subgroup (n\u2009=\u200933) evaluated sensitivity to change over time. Digital measures were only moderately correlated with the MDS-UPDRS (part II-r\u2009=\u20090.60 and parts I and III-r\u2009=\u20090.50). Most associated measures reflected activity quantity and distribution patterns. A model with 14 digital measures accurately distinguished recently diagnosed persons with PD from healthy controls (81.1%, area under the curve: 0.87); digital measures showed larger effect sizes (Cohen's d: [0.19-0.66]), for change over time than any of the MDS-UPDRS parts (Cohen's d: [0.04-0.12]). Real-world mobility measures are moderately associated with clinical assessments, suggesting that they capture different aspects of motor capacity and function. Digital mobility measures are sensitive to early-stage disease and to disease progression, to a larger degree than conventional clinical assessments, demonstrating their utility, primarily for clinical trials but ultimately also for clinical care. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.

Three hundred sixty patients (mean age 66.5\u00a0years, 55% females, 53% A\u03b2 positive) were included.

Tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE) is another name given to ADAM17. Many membrane attached biologically active molecules are cleaved by this enzyme which includes TNFRs and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1. The TNF receptors are of two types TNFR1 and TNFR2. iRhom2 belongs to the pseudo-protease class of rhomboid family, its abundance is observed in the immune cells. Biological activity of ADAM17 is affected in multiple levels by the iRhom2. ADAM17 is trafficked into the Golgi apparatus by the action of iRhom2, where it gets matured proteolytically and is stimulated to perform its function on the cell surface. This process of activation of ADAM17 results in the protection of the organism from the cascade of inflammatory reactions, as this activation blocks the TNF- \u03b1 mediated secretion responsible for inflammatory responses produced.

We aimed to assess the size and frequency of FGF14 expanded alleles in individuals with cerebellar ataxia as compared with controls and to characterize genetic and clinical variability. We sized this repeat in 1876 individuals from France sampled for research purposes in this cross-sectional study: 845 index cases with cerebellar ataxia and 324 affected relatives, 475 controls, as well as 119 cases with spastic paraplegia, and 113 with familial essential tremor. A higher frequency of expanded allele carriers in index cases with ataxia was significant only above 300 GAA repeats (10.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a085) compared with controls (1.1%, n\u00a0=\u00a05) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) whereas GAA250-299 alleles were detected in 1.7% of both groups. Eight of 14 index cases with GAA250-299 repeats had other causal pathogenic variants (4/14) and/or discordance of co-segregation (5/14), arguing against GAA causality. We compared the clinical signs in 127 GAA\u2265300 carriers to cases with non-expanded GAA ataxia resulting in defining a key phenotype triad: onset after 45 years, downbeat nystagmus, episodic ataxic features including diplopia; and a frequent absence of dysarthria. All maternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA were unstable with a median expansion of\u00a0+18 repeats per generation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.44; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In comparison, paternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA mostly decreased in size (-15 GAA (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.63; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)), resulting in the transmission bias observed in SCA27B pedigrees. SCA27B diagnosis must consider both the phenotype and GAA expansion size. In carriers of GAA250-299 repeats, the absence of documented familial transmission and a presentation deviating from the key SCA27B phenotype, should prompt the search for an alternative cause.

        "AbstractText": "The use of biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for developing potential therapeutic treatments. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a well-established tool used to detect \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques in the brain. Previous studies have shown that cross-sectional biomarkers can predict cognitive decline (Schindler et al.,2021). However, it is still unclear whether longitudinal A\u03b2-PET may have additional value for predicting time to cognitive impairment in AD. The current study aims to evaluate the ability of baseline- versus longitudinal rate of change in-11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) A\u03b2-PET to predict cognitive decline. A cohort of 153 participants who previously underwent PiB-PET scans and comprehensive clinical assessments were used in this study. Our analyses revealed that baseline A\u03b2 is significantly associated with the rate of change in cognitive composite scores, with cognition declining more rapidly when baseline PiB A\u03b2 levels were higher. In contrast, no signification association was identified between the rate of change in PiB-PET A\u03b2 and cognitive decline. Additionally, the ability of the rate of change in the PiB-PET measures to predict cognitive decline was significantly influenced by APOE \u03b54 carrier status. These results suggest that a single PiB-PET scan is sufficient to predict cognitive decline and that longitudinal measures of A\u03b2 accumulation do not improve the prediction of cognitive decline once someone is amyloid positive.",

        "AbstractText": "Neighborhood perceptions are associated with physical and mental health outcomes; however, the biological associates of this relationship remain to be fully understood. Here, we evaluate the relationship between neighborhood perceptions and amygdala activity and connectivity with salience network (i.e., insula, anterior cingulate, thalamus) nodes. Forty-eight older adults (mean age = 68 [7] years, 52% female, 47% non-Hispanic Black, 2% Hispanic) without dementia or depression completed the Perceptions of Neighborhood Environment Scale. Lower scores indicated less favorable perceptions of aesthetic quality, walking environment, availability of healthy food, safety, violence (i.e., more perceived violence), social cohesion, and participation in activities with neighbors. Participants separately underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Less favorable perceived safety ( \u03b2 = -0.33, pFDR = .04) and participation in activities with neighbors ( \u03b2 = -0.35, pFDR = .02) were associated with higher left amygdala activity, independent of covariates including psychosocial factors. Less favorable safety perceptions were also associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral insular cortices and the left anterior insula ( \u03b2 = -0.34, pFDR = .04). Less favorable perceived social cohesion was associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the right thalamus ( \u03b2 = -0.42, pFDR = .04), and less favorable perceptions about healthy food availability were associated with enhanced left amygdala functional connectivity with the bilateral anterior insula (right: \u03b2 = -0.39, pFDR = .04; left: \u03b2 = -0.42, pFDR = .02) and anterior cingulate gyrus ( \u03b2 = -0.37, pFDR = .04). Taken together, our findings document relationships between select neighborhood perceptions and amygdala activity as well as connectivity with salience network nodes; if confirmed, targeted community-level interventions and existing community strengths may promote brain-behavior relationships.",

However, many CCC devices do not provide the necessary capacity for identifying novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs in a drug discovery context. Here, we present a high-capacity cell culture microtiter microfluidic plate compliant with American National Standard Institute of the Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening (ANSI/SLAS) standards that allows to parallelize up to 96 CCCs/experimental units, where each experimental unit comprises three microchannel-connected compartments. The plate design allows the specific treatment of cells in individual compartments through the application of a fluidic barrier. Moreover, the compatibility of the plate with neuronal cultures was confirmed with rodent primary as well as human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons of the central or peripheral nervous system for up to 14 days in culture. Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated that the plate design restricts neuronal soma to individual compartments, while axons, but not dendrites, can grow through the connecting microchannels to neighboring compartments. In addition, we show that neurons are spontaneously active and, as deemed by the appearance of synchronous depolarizations in neighboring compartments, are synaptically coupled. In summary, the design of the microfluidic plate allows for both morphological and functional studies of neurological in vitro cultures with increased capacity to support identification of novel mechanisms, targets, or drugs.",

Prior sociological research has uncovered nuanced perspectives of a good death, yet there has been minimal exploration into how marginalised communities reconstruct their own ideals of a good death in response to structural and institutional inequities. Utilising data from 47 in-depth interviews, I examine how transgender older adults perceive and plan for ageing and end-of-life experiences through advance care planning. My analysis reveals transgender older adults' reevaluated notions of a normatively desirable good death for themselves due to existing inequities. Consequently, they actively reconstruct a personalised ideology of death that is adequate enough to meet their end-of-life needs. I further offer the conceptualisation of SATISFICING DEATH, as a process of individuals from marginalised communities reevaluating and reconstructing their own ideologies of a good death that is adequate enough while using resourceful strategies to improve existing social conditions for themselves. These findings highlight the critical need to provide affirming end-of-life care, support, and resources to transgender communities.",

We report herein new quinolinone hybrids as dual inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and A\u03b2 aggregation that function as multitargeted ligands for Alzheimer's disease. The quinoline hybrids (AM1-AM16) were screened for their ability to inhibit AChE, BACE1, amyloid fibrillation, \u03b1-syn aggregation, and tau aggregation. Among the tested compounds, AM5 and AM10 inhibited AChE activity by more than 80% at single-dose screening and possessed a remarkable ability to inhibit the fibrillation of A\u03b242 oligomers at 10 \u03bcM. In addition, dose-dependent screening of AM5 and AM10 was performed, giving half-maximal AChE inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.29 \u00b1 0.13 and 1.72 \u00b1 0.18 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, AM5 and AM10 demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibitory profiles for the aggregation of A\u03b242 oligomers with estimated IC50 values of 4.93 \u00b1 0.8 and 1.42 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, the neuroprotective properties of the lead compounds AM5 and AM10 were determined in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with A\u03b2 oligomers. This work would enable future research efforts aiming at the structural optimization of AM5 and AM10 to develop potent dual inhibitors of AChE and amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, the in vivo assay confirmed the antioxidant activity of compounds AM5 and AM10 through increasing GSH, CAT, and SOD activities that are responsible for scavenging the ROS and restoring its normal level. Blood investigation illustrated the protective activity of the two compounds against lead-induced neurotoxicity through retaining hematological and liver enzymes near normal levels.

        "AbstractText": "Nearly 300,000 older adults experience a hip fracture every year, the majority of which occur following a fall. Unfortunately, recovery after fall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long time in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative recuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and spending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization, identifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is imperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the characteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as contributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to help overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured confounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death. This article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to simultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in health services research, especially when using large administrative claims databases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light computation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic properties with stabilized inference assisted by unsupervised clustering. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate superiority of the proposed estimator compared to existing estimators.",

Recent studies have highlighted the differences in the reliability of GFAP measurements in different biological matrices. The reason for these discrepancies is poorly understood as our knowledge of the protein's 3-dimensional conformation, proteoforms, and aggregation remains limited. Here, we investigate the structural properties of GFAP under different conditions. For this, we characterized recombinant GFAP proteins from various suppliers and applied hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to provide a snapshot of the conformational dynamics of GFAP in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) compared to the phosphate buffer. Our findings indicate that recombinant GFAP exists in various conformational species. Furthermore, we show that GFAP dimers remained intact under denaturing conditions. HDX-MS experiments show an overall decrease in H-bonding and an increase in solvent accessibility of GFAP in aCSF compared to the phosphate buffer, with clear indications of mixed EX2 and EX1 kinetics. To understand possible structural interface regions and the evolutionary conservation profiles, we combined HDX-MS results with the predicted GFAP-dimer structure by AlphaFold-Multimer. We found that deprotected regions with high structural flexibility in aCSF overlap with predicted conserved dimeric 1B and 2B domain interfaces. Structural property predictions combined with the HDX data show an overall deprotection and signatures of aggregation in aCSF. We anticipate that the outcomes of this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the structural flexibility of GFAP and ultimately shed light on its behavior in different biological matrices.",

To examine whether atrophy of hippocampus and hippocampal subfields has occurred in normal aging before a diagnosis of MCI or AD. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of cognitively normal (CN, n\u2009=\u2009144), MCI (n\u2009=\u200990), and AD (n\u2009=\u2009145) participants obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The CN participants were categorized into early dementia converters (CN-C) and non-converters (CN-NC) based on their scores of clinical dementia rating after an average of 36.2\u2009months (range: 6-105\u2009months). We extracted the whole hippocampus and hippocampal subfields for each participant using FreeSurfer, and analyzed the differences in volumes of hippocampus and hippocampal subfields between groups. We then examined the associations between volume of hippocampal subfields and delayed recall scores in each group separately. Hippocampus and most of the hippocampal subfields demonstrated significant atrophy during the progression of AD. The CN-C and CN-NC groups differed in the left hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA). Furthermore, the volume of presubiculum was significantly correlated with delayed recall scores in the CN-NC and AD groups, but not in the CN-C and MCI groups. Hippocampal subfield atrophy (i.e., left HATA) had occurred in cognitively normal elderly individuals before clinical symptoms were recognized. Significant associations of presubiculum with delayed recall scores in the CN-NC and AD groups highlight the essential role of the hippocampal subfields in both early dementia detection and AD progression.",

Pathological tau injection increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181 concentration after 18 months. Tau pathology spreads from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal trisynaptic loop and the cingulate cortex, resuming the experimental progression of Braak stage I to IV. Many AD-related molecular networks were impacted by tau seeds injections regardless of A\u03b2 injections in proteomic analyses. However, we found mature neurofibrillary tangles, increased CSF total-tau concentration, and pre- and postsynaptic degeneration only in A\u03b2 co-injected macaques.

Recent studies have shown that these biomolecular condensates can play both promoting and inhibitory roles in fibrillar protein self-assembly, a process that is linked to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and various prion diseases. Yet, the exact regulatory role of these condensates in protein aggregation remains unknown. By employing microfluidics to create artificial protein compartments, the self-assembly behavior of the fibrillar protein lysozyme within them can be characterized. It is observed that the volumetric parameters of protein-rich compartments can change the kinetics of protein self-assembly. Depending on the change in compartment parameters, the lysozyme fibrillation process either accelerated or decelerated. Furthermore, the results confirm that the volumetric parameters govern not only the nucleation and growth phases of the fibrillar aggregates but also affect the crosstalk between the protein-rich and protein-poor phases. The appearance of phase-separated compartments in the vicinity of natively folded protein complexes triggers their abrupt percolation into the compartments' core and further accelerates protein aggregation. Overall, the results of the study shed more light on the complex behavior and functions of protein-rich phases and, importantly, on their interaction with the surrounding environment.",

We utilized FDG PET to evaluate which brain regions are most susceptible to altered glucose metabolism after chemoradiation in patients with head and neck cancer (HNCa). Real-world FDG PET images were acquired as standard of care before and after chemoradiation for HNCa in 68 patients. Linear mixed-effects voxelwise models assessed changes after chemoradiation in cerebral glucose metabolism quantified with standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), covarying for follow-up time and patient demographics. Voxelwise analysis revealed two large clusters of decreased glucose metabolism in the medial frontal and polar temporal cortices following chemoradiation, with decreases of approximately 5% SUVR after therapy. These findings provide evidence that standard chemoradiation for HNCa can lead to decreased neuronal glucose metabolism, contributing to literature emphasizing the vulnerability of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes, especially in HNCa, where these areas may be particularly vulnerable to indirect radiation-induced injury.

Despite the evidence supporting the association between tau proteins and brain atrophy, further studies are needed to explore their link to neuronal dysfunction in the human brain. To clarify the relationship between neuronal dysfunction and abnormal proteins in AD-affected brains, we conducted magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and assessed the neurofilament light chain plasma levels (NfL). We evaluated tau and amyloid-\u03b2 depositions using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of florzolotau (18F) for tau and 11C-PiB for amyloid-\u03b2 positron emission tomography in the same patients. Heatmaps were generated to visualize Z scores of glutamate to creatine (Glu/Cr) and N-acetylaspartate to creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios using data from healthy controls. In AD brains, Z score maps revealed reduced Glu/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios in the gray matter, particularly in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Glu/Cr ratios were negatively correlated with florzolotau (18F) SUVRs in the PCC, and plasma NfL levels were elevated and negatively correlated with Glu/Cr (P\u00a0=\u00a00.040, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.50) and NAA/Cr ratios (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.68) in the rDLPFC. This suggests that the abnormal tau proteins in AD-affected brains play a role in diminishing glutamate levels. Furthermore, neuronal dysfunction markers including Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr could potentially indicate favorable clinical outcomes.

It was shown that the proteome of the studied MLOs consists of intrinsically disordered proteins, 30-40% of which are potentially capable of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).

An increase in the relative content of DNA-, but not RNA-binding proteins, was also found in the SG dataset with senescence-related processes. Among SGs proteins potentially involved in senescent processes, there is an increase in the abundance of potentially amyloidogenic proteins compared to the whole proteome. Proteins common to SGs and P-bodies, potentially involved in processes associated with senescence, form clusters of interacting proteins. The largest cluster is represented by RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA processing and translation regulation.

A combination of fixed-dose therapeutic doses of donepezil and memantine is potentially more appropriate than the simultaneous use of two recommended drugs for the treatment of AD, which will improve treatment adherence in patients with moderate to severe AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Hyperpolarization techniques significantly enhance the sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) and thus present fascinating new directions for research and applications with in vivo MR imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S). Hyperpolarized 13C MRI/S, in particular, enables real-time non-invasive assessment of metabolic processes and holds great promise for a diverse range of clinical applications spanning fields like oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with a potential for improving early diagnosis of disease, patient stratification, and therapy response assessment. Despite its potential, technical challenges remain for achieving clinical translation. This paper provides an overview of the discussions that took place at the international workshop \"New Horizons in Hyperpolarized 13C MRI,\" in March 2023 at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Munich, Germany. The workshop covered new developments, as well as future directions, in topics including polarization techniques (particularly focusing on parahydrogen-based methods), novel probes, considerations related to data acquisition and analysis, and emerging clinical applications in oncology and other fields.",

        "AbstractText": "Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and subsequent oxidative stress, resulting in a cascade of cytotoxic effects. Fangchinoline (Fan), a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from traditional Chinese herb Stephania tetrandra S. Moorec, has been reported to possess multiple potent biological activities, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the potential neuroprotective efficacy of Fan against AD remains unknown. Methods: N2AAPP cells, the mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells stably transfected with human Swedish mutant APP695, were served as an in vitro AD model. A mouse model of AD was constructed by microinjection of A\u03b21-42 peptides into lateral ventricle of WT mice. The neuroprotective effects of Fan on AD were investigated through a combination of Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation and behavioral assessments. Results and discussion: It was found that Fan effectively attenuated the amyloidogenic processing of APP by augmenting autophagy and subsequently fostering lysosomal degradation of BACE1 in N2AAPP cells, as reflected by the decrease in P62 levels, concomitant with the increase in Beclin-1 and LC3-II levels. More importantly, Fan significantly ameliorated cognitive impairment in an A\u03b21-42-induced mouse model of AD via the induction of autophagy and the inhibition of oxidative stress, as evidenced by an increase in antioxidants including glutathione reductase (GR), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and a decrease in pro-oxidants including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS), coupled with a reduction in apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, our study demonstrate that Fan ameliorates cognitive dysfunction through promoting autophagy and mitigating oxidative stress, making it a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

In the EA group, EA (2 Hz/100 Hz, 20 min) was applied to GV20 and EX-HN3 in combination with manual acupuncture stimulation of GV26. The treatment was performed once a day, for a total of 28 days. The mice in the three groups were given the same fixation and grasping operation. Morris water maze swimming tests were used to assess the mice's learning-memory ability. Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe the morphological changes of neurons in the hippocampus. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus tissue was detected by superoxide anionic colorimetric assay kit (WST-1), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were detected by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. The expression levels of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (ptgs2) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA in the hippocampus were detected by fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR. Behavioral results showed that compared with the control group, the escape latencies at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th day of Morris water maze swimming test were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the swimming time in the original platform quadrant and the times of cros-sing the original platform were considerably decreased (P<0.05) in the model group. In comparison with the model group, the escape latencies at the 4th and 5th day were strikingly decreased (P<0.05), and the swimming time in the original platform quadrant and times of crossing the original platform significantly increased (P<0.05) in the EA group. Following modeling, the SOD activity and the expression of GPX4 mRNA were obviously down-regulated (P<0.05), and the content of MDA and the expression of ptgs2 mRNA significantly up-regulated (P<0.05) in the model group rele-vant to the control group. The SOD activity and the expression of GPX4 mRNA were apparently increased (P<0.05), and the content of MDA and the expression of ptgs2 mRNA remarkably down-regulated (P<0.05) in the EA group rele-vant to the model group. Histopathological and ultrastructural results showed scattered arrangement of cells, widened space among cells, reduction in the number of cells, and many shrunk of dissolved nucleoli, shrunking and incomplete mitochondria, and high membrane electron density in the hippocampus of the model group, which was relatively milder in the EA group. \"Tongdu Qishen\" acupuncture can improve the learning-memory ability of AD mice, which may be related to its functions in up-regulating SOD activity and GPX4 mRNA expression, and down-regulating MDA content and ptgs2 mRNA expression to reduce the lipid peroxidation in the process of ferroptosis.",

The data source includes acute care hospital to SNF transitions identified using 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, 2017-2019. We model and compare the estimated effect of facility \"preferredness\" on SNF choice for patients with and without ADRD. We use conditional logistic regression with a 1:1 patient sample otherwise matched on demographic and encounter characteristics. Our matched sample included 58,190 patients, selected from a total observed population of 3,019,260 Medicare hospitalizations that resulted in an SNF transfer between 2017 and 2019. Overall, patients with ADRD have a lower probability of being discharged to a preferred SNF (52.0% vs. 54.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Choice model estimation using our matched sample suggests similarly that the marginal effect of preferredness on a patient choosing a proximate SNF is 2.4 percentage points lower for patients with ADRD compared with those without (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The differential effect of preferredness based on ADRD status increases when considering (a) the cumulative effect of multiple SNFs in close geographic proximity, (b) the magnitude of the strength of hospital-SNF relationship, and (c) comparing patients with more versus less advanced ADRD. Preferred relationships are significantly predictive of where a patient receives SNF care, but this effect is weaker for patients with ADRD. To the extent that these high-volume relationships are indicative of more targeted transitional care improvements from hospitals, ADRD patients may not be fully benefiting from these investments. Hospital leaders can leverage integrated care relationships to reduce SNFs' perceived need to engage in selection behavior (i.e., enhanced resource sharing and transparency in placement practices). Policy intervention may be needed to address selection behavior and to support hospitals in making systemic improvements that can better benefit all SNF partners (i.e., more robust information sharing systems).",

Etiologically, dysfunction of cholinergic neurotransmitter system is prominent in AD. However, disease modifying drug for AD is still unavailable. We hypothesized that krill oil and modified krill oil containing 20 % lysophosphatidylcholine-docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA, LPC20K) could play a crucial role in AD by improving cognitive functions measured by several behavioral tests. We found that LPC20K could ameliorate short-term, long-term, spatial, and object recognition memory under cholinergic hypofunction states. To find the underlying mechanism involved in the effect of LPC20K on cognitive function, we investigated changes of signaling molecules using Western blotting. Expression levels of protein kinase C zeta (PKC\u03b6) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), and phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \u2161 (CaMK\u2161), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were significantly increased in LPC20K-administered group compared to those in the memory impairment group. Moreover, the expression levels of BDNF were temporally increased especially 6 or 9\u00a0h after administration of LPC20K compared with the control group. These results suggest that LPC20K could ameliorate memory impairment caused by hypocholinergic state by enhancing the expression levels of PKC\u03b6 and PSD-95, and phosphorylation levels of ERK, CaMK\u2161 and CREB and increasing BDNF expression levels. Therefore, LPC20K could be used as a dietary supplement against cognitive impairment observed in diseases such as AD with a hypocholinergic state.",

Here, we subjected mice to long-term exposure to amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (APS-NPs). These nanoplastics were detected in the mouse brain; coupled with the observed upregulation of Alzheimer's disease-associated genes (APP and MAPT). To further explore nanoplastic damage mechanisms and the corresponding protective strategies against these mechanisms in vitro, we used hCMEC/D3 and HT22 cells. Results showed that APS-NPs disrupted tight junction proteins (Occludin and ZO-1) via TLR2/MMP9 axis, resulting in blood-brain barrier permeation; this was significantly mitigated by functional food Camellia pollen treatment. APS-NPs initiated iNOS and nNOS upregulation within neurons resulting in Sirtuin 1 deacetylase inactivation and CBP acetyltransferase stimulation, ultimately leading to Ac-Tau formation. This process was attenuated by Camellia pollen, which also ameliorated the APS-NPs-induced neuronal apoptosis mediated by the p53/Bax/Bcl-2 axis. Network pharmacology analysis of Camellia pollen offered a further theoretical understanding of its potential applications in preventing and treating nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This study established that Camellia pollen protects the brain against APS-NPs-mediated blood-brain barrier damage and alleviates neuronal apoptosis and Alzheimer's disease-like neurotoxicity.

Genetic and environmental factors are believed to be responsible for neuronal diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. It is difficult to restore normal nervous function after neurodegeneration; hence, prevention could be the best strategy against these diseases. Ayurved medicines such as Suvarna Bhasma (SB) have enormous potential to treat these neurological diseases. The aim of this study is to examine the protective effect of SB against rotenone-induced Parkinson's-like model in zebrafish. In this study, we induced Parkinson's-like disease model in zebrafish by inducing it with rotenone (7\u00a0\u03bcg/L). We examined the behavioural, proteomics and dopamine alterations of rotenone induced zebrafish of SB pre-treated group as compared to the control group. The behavioural experiments showed that due to rotenone exposure, Parkinson's-like behavioural abnormality was induced in zebrafish. However, because of SB treatment, this behavioural abnormality was reduced. The proteomics study of zebrafish brains clearly showed that the SB-treated group was not significantly affected due to rotenone exposure. However, in the SB non-treated group, expression of nine proteins that are linked to Parkinson's disease (gene name: sncgb, ywhae1, ywhah, uchl1, ywhaba, psma6a, ywhabl, ywhaqb, and ywhabb) were differentially expressed after rotenone exposure.

Currently, there is a lack of effective methods for rapidly and sensitively identifying NO and elucidating its relationship with neurological diseases. Novel diamino-cyclic-metalloiridium phosphorescence probes, Ir-CDA and Ir-BDA, have been designed to visualize the gasotransmitter NO in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glioblastoma (GBM). Ir-CDA and Ir-BDA utilize iridium (III) as the central ion and incorporate a diamino group as a ligand. The interaction between the diamino structure and NO leads to the formation of a three-nitrogen five-membered ring structure, which opens up phosphorescence. The two probes can selectively bind to NO and offer low detection limits. Additionally, Ir-BDA/Ir-CDA can image NO in brain cancer cell models, neuroinflammatory models, and AD cell models. Furthermore, the NO content in fresh brain sections from AD mice was considerably higher than that in wild-type (WT) mice. Consequently, it is plausible that NO is generated in significant quantities around cells hosting larger A\u03b2 deposits, gradually diffusing throughout the entire brain region. Furthermore, we posit that this phenomenon is a key factor contributing to the higher brain NO content in AD mice compared to that in WT mice.

        "AbstractText": "By utilizing a high-temperature superconducting quantum interference device (high-Tc SQUID) magnetometer, an alternating current (AC) magnetosusceptometer, referred to as an analyzer, was developed for ultrasensitive immunoassays. The analyzer has been applied to assay biomarkers in human plasma associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The involved assay methodology is the so-called immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). Such an analyzer has been approved for clinical use in Taiwan and Europe. The mass production of the analyzer is needed for clinical utilities. The issue of exploring analyzer-to-analyzer variations in the performances becomes critical. Unfortunately, there is no standard characterization to determine the variations in performances among analyzers. In this study, key characterizations, such as output signal stability, signal-to-noise ratio, measured concentrations of a control sample, etc., are proposed. In total, three analyzers are characterized in this work. The detected biomarkers include amyloid peptides, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau protein, and \u03b1-synuclein protein for AD and PD. Through one-way ANOVA for any of the characterizations among the three analyzers, it was found that there was no significant difference in any of these characterizations among the analyzers (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the three analyzers are applied to assay biomolecules for AD and PD in reference samples. High correlations (r > 0.8) in measured concentrations of any of these biomarkers in reference samples were obtained among the three analyzers. The results demonstrate that the proposed characterizations are feasible for achieving consistent performance among high-Tc SQUID-based AC magnetosusceptometers for assaying biomolecules.",

        "ArticleTitle": "The relationship between perceived stigma and perceived stress in cognitive decline: a survey of persons with mild cognitive impairment and their caregivers.",
        "AbstractText": "While Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia have rapidly become a global health crisis with growing incidence that is unabated, the incidence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) far exceeds that of Alzheimer's disease. Persons with MCI demonstrate some level of cognitive impairment, but daily functions remain intact and there is no certainty that they will develop dementia. Yet, the possibility conjures a considerable amount of fear and anxiety, further fueled by a vast array of misconceptions and stigma. The pervasive nature of this stigma permeates society and culture at many levels. Persons with MCI who are at higher risk for development of dementia may be especially vulnerable to fear and stigma associated with the diagnosis. Based on this premise, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stigma and perceived stress in persons with MCI and their care partners, including the relationship between income and the study variables. The secondary aim was to examine the effect of a combined cognitive rehabilitation and wellness program on these perceptions. Thirty participants were recruited from Mayo Clinic's Health Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program. MCI (n\u2009=\u200915) and care partner (n\u2009=\u200915) participants completed the Stigma Impact Scale (SIS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) before and after the HABIT program. Average SIS and PSS scores decreased in the MCI, care partner, and combined groups, both pre- and post-HABIT. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between perceived stigma and stress, controlling for income. A significant relationship was found between perceived stigma and perceived stress both pre and post-HABIT. The results suggest a relationship exists between perceived stigma and perceived stress in persons with MCI and their care partners, and an educational program such as HABIT may strengthen this relationship by informing participants of potential challenges that occur in cognitive decline. Understanding these relationships may provide an opportunity to provide tools for this vulnerable population.",

        "AbstractText": "Spontaneous activity during the resting state, tracked by BOLD fMRI imaging, or shortly rsfMRI, gives rise to brain-wide dynamic patterns of interregional correlations, whose structured flexibility relates to cognitive performance. Here, we analyze resting-state dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in a cohort of older adults, including amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, N = 34) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, N = 13) patients, as well as normal control (NC, N = 16) and cognitively \"supernormal\" controls (SNC, N = 10) subjects. Using complementary state-based and state-free approaches, we find that resting-state fluctuations of different functional links are not independent but are constrained by high-order correlations between triplets or quadruplets of functionally connected regions. When contrasting patients with healthy subjects, we find that dFC between cingulate and other limbic regions is increasingly bursty and intermittent when ranking the four groups from SNC to NC, aMCI and AD. Furthermore, regions affected at early stages of AD pathology are less involved in higher order interactions in patient than in control groups, while pairwise interactions are not significantly reduced. Our analyses thus suggest that the spatiotemporal complexity of dFC organization is precociously degraded in AD and provides a richer window into the underlying neurobiology than time-averaged FC connections.",

Recent research highlights the role of NMDA receptors in AD development, as excessive activation of these receptors triggers excitotoxicity. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, shows promise in curbing excitotoxicity. What sets our study apart is our novel exploration of memantine's potential to protect hippocampal neurons from neurotoxicity induced by NMDA and amyloid \u03b21-42, a hallmark of AD. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments using rat hippocampal cell cultures. We employed Hoechst and propidium iodide double staining to assess neuronal viability. Analyzing the viability of neurons in normal conditions compared to their status after 24\u2009h of exposure to the respective agents revealed compelling results. The incubation of hippocampal neurons with NMDA or amyloid \u03b21-42 led to a more than twofold increase in the number of apoptotic and necrotic neurons. However, when memantine was co-administered with NMDA or amyloid \u03b21-42, we witnessed a notable augmentation in the number of viable cells. This unique approach not only suggests that memantine may act as a neuroprotective agent but also emphasizes the relevance of hippocampal neuron cultures as valuable models for investigating excitotoxicity and potential AD treatments.",

        "AbstractText": "In the past 50 years, life expectancy has increased by more than 20 years. One consequence of this increase in longevity is the rise of age-related diseases such as dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60-70% of cases. AD pathogenesis is not restricted to the neuronal compartment but includes strong interactions with other brain cells, particularly microglia triggering the release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. There is growing evidence revealing the diverse clinical benefits of postbiotics in many prevalent conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we tested the ability of bacterial conditioned media (BCM) derived from selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains to regulate core mechanisms relevant to AD pathophysiology in the microglia cell line BV-2. Levilactobacillus brevis CRL 2013, chosen for its efficient production of the neurotransmitter GABA, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis CRL 581, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, were selected alongside Enterococcus mundtii CRL 35, a LAB strain that can significantly modulate cytokine production. BCM from all 3 strains displayed antioxidant capabilities, reducing oxidative stress triggered by beta-amyloid oligomers (oA\u03b21-42). Additionally, BCM effectively mitigated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, namely, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 triggered by oA\u03b21-42. Furthermore, our study identified that BCM from CRL 581 inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a crucial enzyme in AD progression, in both human erythrocytes and mouse brain tissues. Notably, the inhibitory effect was mediated by low-molecular-weight components of the BCM. L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis CRL 581 emerged as a favorable candidate for production of postbiotics with potential benefits for AD therapy since it demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, reduction of cytokine expression, and partial AChE inhibition. On the other hand, E. mundtii CRL 35 showed that the antioxidant activity failed to inhibit AChE and caused induction of iNOS expression, rendering it unsuitable as a potential therapeutic for AD. This study unveils the potential benefits of LAB-derived postbiotics for the development of new avenues for therapeutic interventions for AD.",

LINGO-1 is a negative regulator of nerve growth, and whether antagonizing LINGO-1 can attenuate synaptic pruning by microglia and rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus in AD is still unclear. On this basis, the anti-LINGO-1 antibody, which binds to LINGO-1 protein and antagonizes the effects of LINGO-1, was administered to 10-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice for 2\u00a0months. The Morris water maze test, immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence and 3D reconstruction were used. Compared to wild-type mice, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had worse performance on behavioral tests, fewer dendritic spines but more microglia in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, the microglia in APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more branches of medium length (4-6\u00a0\u00b5m) and a cell body area with greater variability. Moreover, APP/PS1 transgenic mice had more postsynaptic termini colocalized with microglia in the hippocampus than wild-type mice. The anti-LINGO-1 antibody significantly reversed these changes in AD, indicating that the anti-LINGO-1 antibody can improve hippocampus-dependent learning and memory abilities and effectively rescue dendritic spines in the hippocampus of AD mice and that microglia might participate in this progression in AD. These results provide a scientific basis for further studying the mechanism of the anti-LINGO-1 antibody in AD and help to elucidate the role of LINGO-1 in the treatment of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Paraoxonase (PON) enzymes (PON1, PON2 and PON3) exert antioxidant properties through arylesterase, lactonase and paraoxonase activities. Increasing findings suggested their potential involvement, particularly PON1 and PON2, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative pathology characterized by early oxidative stress. Specifically, decreased serum PON1-arylesterase and lactonase activities seem to be associated with an increased brain oxidative damage in early AD, leading to hypothesize that PON activity alterations might be an early event in AD. To address this hypothesis, the levels of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; i.e. a marker of oxidative stress damage) along with the protein expression and enzymatic activity of PON1 and PON2 have been investigated in the brain and serum of young [Postnatal day (PD)8-10, 20-25 and 60-65] asymptomatic 3xTg-AD female mice, one of the most used transgenic models of AD. At PD 8-10, there were no differences in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) 4-HNE expression levels between 3xTg-AD mice compared to controls (Non-Tg mice). On the other hand, significant increased levels of 4-HNE were detected in PD 20-30 3xTg-AD mice hippocampus, while a significant reduction was observed in 3xTg-AD group at PD 60-65. In the PFC, 4-HNE levels were significantly reduced in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30, while no differences in 4-HNE levels were detected at PD 60-65. No significant differences in arylesterase and lactonase activities were observed in the plasma of 3xTg-AD and Non-Tg mice at the different considered ages. Compared to Non-Tg mice, a reduction of brain arylesterase activity was found in 3xTg-AD female at PD 20-30 and PD 60-65, but it was significant only in the younger group. Finally, a similar trend was observed also for PON1 and PON2 protein levels, with both significantly, and solely, decreased in 3xTg-AD mice brain at PD 20-30. Overall, these findings suggest that the altered oxidative stress homeostasis in the 3xTg-AD female mice may be related to an early reduction in activity and expression of PONs enzymes most likely via a reduced brain arylesterases activity.",

It is projected that the number of affected individuals will reach a staggering 150 million by 2050. While recent advancements in monoclonal antibodies targeting A\u03b2 have shown some clinical effects, there is an urgent need for improved therapies to effectively address the impeding surge of AD patients worldwide. To achieve this, a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying the disease is crucial. In recent years, mounting evidence has underscored the vital role of the innate immune system in AD pathology. However, limited findings persist regarding the involvement of the adaptive immune system. Here, we report on the impact of the adaptive immune system on various aspects of AD by using AppNL-G-F mice crossed into a Rag2-/- background lacking mature adaptive immune cells. In addition, to simulate the continuous exposure to various challenges such as infections that is commonly observed in humans, the innate immune system was activated through the repetitive induction of peripheral inflammation. We observed a remarkably improved performance on complex cognitive tasks when a mature adaptive immune system is absent. Notably, this observation is pathologically associated with lower A\u03b2 plaque accumulation, reduced glial activation, and better-preserved neuronal networks in the mice lacking a mature adaptive immune system. Collectively, these findings highlight the detrimental role of the adaptive immune system in AD and underscore the need for effective strategies to modulate it for therapeutic purposes.",

We propose a novel distributed algorithm for fitting regularized Cox proportional hazards model when data sharing among different data providers is restricted. Based on cyclical coordinate descent, the proposed algorithm computes intermediary statistics by each site and then exchanges them to update the model parameters in other sites without accessing individual patient-level data. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world data analysis predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Moreover, we compared the performance of our method with existing privacy-preserving models. Our algorithm achieves privacy-preserving variable selection for time-to-event data in the vertically distributed setting, without degradation of accuracy compared with a centralized approach. Simulation demonstrates that our algorithm is highly efficient in analyzing high-dimensional datasets. Real-world data analysis reveals that our distributed Cox model yields higher accuracy in predicting the risk of Alzheimer's dementia than the conventional Cox model built by each data provider without data sharing. Moreover, our algorithm is computationally more efficient compared with existing privacy-preserving Cox models with or without regularization term. The proposed algorithm is lossless, privacy-preserving and highly efficient to fit regularized Cox model for vertically distributed data.

Modern medicine N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist memantine (Mm) are mainly used in the clinical treatment of AD. TCM Cerebralcare Granule\u00ae (CG) has long been an effective treatment for headaches, dizziness, and other symptoms. In this study, we employ a blend of CG and Mm to address Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms and explore their impacts and underlying mechanisms. The objective of our study was to observe the effects of CG combined with Memantine (Mm) on learning and memory impairment of AD mice induced by D-galactose and to explore the mechanism at work. CG and Mm were combined to target multiple pathological processes involved in AD. For a thorough analysis, we performed various experiments such as behavioral detection, pathological detection, proteomic detection, and other experimental methods of detection. It was found that the combination of CG and Mm was significantly effective for improving learning and memory in AD mice as well as brain pathology. The serum and hippocampal tissue of AD mice were significantly enhanced with catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were decreased with this treatment. In AD mice, a combination of Mm and CG (CG\u00a0+\u00a0Mm) significantly increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory factors IL-4 and IL-10, decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), improved synaptic plasticity by restoring synaptophysin (SYP) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus, enhanced A\u03b2 phagocytosis of microglia in AD mice, and increased mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes I, II, III, and IV, lead to an increase in the number of functionally active NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which accounts for the most cases of dementia worldwide. Impaired memory, including acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval, is one of the hallmarks in AD. At the cellular level, dysregulated synaptic plasticity partly due to reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long-term depression (LTD) underlies the memory deficits in AD. GluA3 containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are one of key receptors involved in rapid neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies revealed a novel form of GluA3 involved in neuronal plasticity that is dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), rather than N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). However, this cAMP-dependent GluA3 pathway is specifically and significantly impaired by amyloid beta (A\u03b2), a pathological marker of AD. cAMP is a key second messenger that plays an important role in modulating memory and synaptic plasticity. We previously reported that exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 2 (Epac2), acting as a main cAMP effector, plays a specific and time-limited role in memory retrieval. From electrophysiological perspective, Epac2 facilities the maintenance of LTP, a cellular event closely associated with memory retrieval. Additionally, Epac2 was found to be involved in the GluA3-mediated plasticity. In this review, we comprehensively summarize current knowledge regarding the specific roles of GluA3 and Epac2 in synaptic plasticity and memory, and their potential association with AD.",

Additionally, we integrated genome-wide association study results for depression (n\u00a0= 500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 14,048 unique genes in 7 cell types and 52 cell subtypes to perform a transcriptome-wide association study of depression followed by Mendelian randomization. Our single-nucleus transcriptome-wide association study analysis identified 68 candidate genes for depression and showed the greatest number being in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Of the 68 genes, 53 were novel compared to previous studies. Notably, gene expression in different neuronal subtypes had varying effects on depression risk. Traits with high genetic correlations with depression, such as neuroticism, shared more transcriptome-wide association study genes than traits that were not highly correlated with depression. Complementing these analyses, differential gene expression analysis across 52 neocortical cell subtypes showed that genes such as KCNN2, SCAI, WASF3, and SOCS6 were associated with late-life depressive symptoms in specific cell subtypes. These 2 sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large single-nucleus RNA sequencing data both to uncover genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depressive symptoms and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered genome-wide association studies so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development.",

To explore whether abnormally phosphorylated Tau causes metal ion deposition, we overexpressed human full-length Tau (hTau) in the hippocampal CA3 area of mice and primary cultured hippocampal neurons (CPHN) and found that Tau accumulation induced iron deposition and activated calcineurin (CaN), which dephosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2), mediating Tau hyperphosphorylation.

Since G-actin is a quasi-stationary, thermodynamically unstable form, it can gradually transform into inactivated state in the absence of chelating/denaturating agents or heat exposure, but the transition is much slower.

Fifty animals were allocated to five groups, which received saline (vehicle control, group 1), a combination of saline and aluminium chloride (AlCl3) (disease control, group 2), coconut oil (COO) (SFE extracted, treatment group 3), turmeric oleoresin (Cur) (SFE extracted, treatment group 4) and SFE co-extract of turmeric powder and coconut shreds (CurCOO) (treatment group 5). Animals were subjected to behavioural evaluation. In addition, the hippocampal section of the brain from all groups was subjected to biochemical, molecular and histopathological evaluations. The results showed CurCOO administered intranasally improved cognitive abilities, reversed histological alterations in the brain, reduced hippocampus inflammation studied through proinflammatory cytokine markers like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as compared to the disease control group. The impact of CurCOO on preventive neurodegeneration was also observed through a reduction in protein transcription factor NF-kB in the treated group 5 as compared to a disease control group. The effect of intranasal delivery of CurCOO on the neurons responsible for memory consolidation was evident from low acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in the treated groups with respect to AlCl3 induced group. Summarily, the results demonstrated intranasal delivery of CurCOO to show better efficacy than Cur and COO in preventing neurodegeneration associated with AlCl3 induced Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as a widespread neurodegenerative disorder marked by the gradual onset of memory impairment, predominantly impacting the elderly. With projections indicating a substantial surge in AD diagnoses, exceeding 13.8 million individuals by 2050, there arises an urgent imperative to discern novel biomarkers for AD. To accomplish these objectives, we explored immune cell infiltration and the expression patterns of immune cells and immune function-related genes of AD patients. Furthermore, we utilized the consensus clustering method combined with aggrephagy-related genes (ARGs) for typing AD patients and categorized AD specimens into distinct clusters (C1, C2). A total of 272 candidate genes were meticulously identified through a combination of differential analysis and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, we applied three machine learning algorithms-namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and generalized linear model (GLM)-to pinpoint a pathogenic signature comprising five genes associated with AD. To validate the predictive accuracy of these identified genes in discerning AD progression, we constructed nomograms. Our analyses uncovered that cluster C2 exhibits a higher immune expression than C1. Based on the ROC(0.956). We identified five characteristic genes (PFKFB4, PDK3, KIAA0319L, CEBPD, and PHC2T) associated with AD immune cells and function. The nomograms constructed on the basis of these five diagnostic genes demonstrated effectiveness. In the validation group, the ROC values were found to be 0.760 and 0.838, respectively. These results validate the robustness and reliability of the diagnostic model, affirming its potential for accurate identification of AD. Our findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD but also offer valuable insights for drug development and clinical analysis. The limitation of our study is the limited sample size, and although AD-related genes were identified and some of the mechanisms elucidated, further experiments are needed to elucidate the more in-depth mechanisms of these characterized genes in the disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects the central nervous system, specifically the motor system. It is mainly caused by the loss of dopamine due to the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) protein in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Previous studies have reported that immunization may be a potential preventive strategy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, the aim of the study was to design an \u03b1-syn specific epitope vaccine and investigate its effect in PD-related pathophysiology using an \u03b1-syn-induced mouse model. We used an in silico model to identify and design a non-toxic \u03b1-syn-based peptide epitope vaccine and, to overcome poor immunogenicity, the vaccine was coupled with immunogenic carrier proteins, i.e., ovalbumin (OVA) and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Our results showed that vaccinated PD mouse models, especially with vaccines with carrier proteins, improved in motor functions compared with the non-vaccinated PD model. Additionally, the vaccinated groups showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the spleen and plasma as well as decreased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the plasma. Furthermore, vaccinated groups, especially OVA and KLH groups, showed decrease in \u03b1-syn levels and increased dopamine-related markers, i.e., tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), vesicle monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT), and autophagy activities in the striatum and SNpc. Lastly, our data showed decreased neuroinflammation by reducing the activation of microglia and astrocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunized groups, especially with OVA and KLH carrier proteins. Overall, these results suggest that vaccination, especially with immunogenic carrier proteins, is effective in reducing the accumulation of \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain and ameliorate PD-related pathophysiology. Hence, further development of this approach might have a potential role in preventing the development of PD.",

        "AbstractText": "Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to either exogenous (PAMPs) or endogenous (DAMPs) stimuli results in the production of IL-18, caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2. These cytokines have a beneficial role in promoting inflammation, but an excessive activation of the inflammasome and the consequent constitutive inflammatory status plays a role in human pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagic removal of NLRP3 inflammasome activators can reduce inflammasome activation and inflammation. Likewise, inflammasome signaling pathways regulate autophagy, allowing the development of inflammatory responses but preventing excessive and detrimental inflammation. Nanotechnology led to the development of liposome engineered nanovectors (NVs) that can load and carry drugs. We verified in an in vitro model of AD-associated inflammation the ability of Glibenclamide-loaded NVs (GNVs) to modulate the balance between inflammasome activation and autophagy. Human THP1dM cells were LPS-primed and oligomeric A\u00df-stimulated in the presence/absence of GNVs. IL-1\u03b2, IL-18 and activated caspase-1 production was evaluated by the Automated Immunoassay System (ELLA); ASC speck formation (a marker of NLRP3 activation) was analyzed by FlowSight Imaging flow-cytometer (AMNIS); the expression of autophagy targets was investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot (WB); and the modulation of autophagy-related up-stream signaling pathways and Tau phosphorylation were WB-quantified. Results showed that GNVs reduce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and prevent the A\u00df-induced phosphorylation of ERK, AKT, and p70S6 kinases, potentiating autophagic flux and counteracting Tau phosphorylation. These preliminary results support the investigation of GNVs as a possible novel strategy in disease and rehabilitation to reduce inflammasome-associated inflammation.",

We conducted a prescription sequence symmetry analysis using the University of Groningen IADB.nl prescription database. We determined the order of the first prescription for treating AD and the first prescription for beta-blockers, with the dispensing date of the first prescription for AD defined as the index date. Participants were adults over 45 years old starting any AD medication and beta-blockers within two years. We calculated adjusted sequence ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. We identified 510 users of both AD and beta-blockers, and 145 participants were eligible. The results were compatible with either a significant decrease in the incidence of AD after using beta-blockers (adjusted sequence ratio (aSR) = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35-0.72) or, conversely, an increase in beta-blockers after AD medication (aSR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.61-2.30).

MRI is able to detect a wide range of diseases and conditions, including nervous system disorders and cancer, and uses the principles of NMR relaxation to generate detailed internal images of the body. For such investigation, different metal complexes have been studied as potential MRI contrast agents. With this in mind, this work aims to investigate two systems containing the vanadium complexes [VO(metf)2]\u00b7H2O (VC1) and [VO(bpy)2Cl]+ (VC2), being metformin and bipyridine ligands of the respective complexes, with the biological targets AMPK and ULK1. These biomolecules are involved in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively, and may act as promising spectroscopic probes for detection of these diseases. To initially evaluate the behavior of the studied ligands within the aforementioned protein active sites and aqueous environment, four classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including VC1 + H2O (1), VC2 + H2O (2), VC1 + AMPK + H2O (3), and VC2 + ULK1 + H2O (4) were performed. From this, it was obtained that for both systems containing VCs and water only, the theoretical calculations implied a higher efficiency when compared with DOTAREM, a famous commercially available contrast agent for MRI. This result is maintained when evaluating the system containing VC1 + AMPK + H2O. Nevertheless, for the system VC2 + ULK1 + H2O, there was observed a decrease in the vanadium complex efficiency due to the presence of a relevant steric hindrance. Despite that, due to the nature of the interaction between VC2 and ULK1, and the nature of its ligands, the study gives an insight that some modifications on VC2 structure might improve its efficiency as an MRI probe.",

It is the main hub of exercise-upregulated mitochondrial proteins and is involved in a variety of metabolic pathways including neurosteroid metabolism to regulate allopregnanolone homeostasis. Deacetylation of 17\u03b2-HSD10 by sirtuins helps regulate its catalytic activities. 17\u03b2-HSD10 may also play a critical role in the control of mitochondrial structure, morphology and dynamics by acting as a member of the Parkin/PINK1 pathway, and by binding to cyclophilin D to open mitochondrial permeability pore. 17\u03b2-HSD10 also serves as a component of RNase P necessary for mitochondrial tRNA maturation. This dehydrogenase can bind with the A\u03b2 peptide thereby enhancing neurotoxicity to brain cells. Even in the absence of A\u03b2, its quantitative and qualitative variations can result in neurodegeneration.

The ACH2.0, a recently introduced theory of AD, preserves this attribute but otherwise differs fundamentally from the ACH. It posits that AD is a two-stage disorder where both stages are driven by intraneuronal (rather than extracellular) A\u03b2 (iA\u03b2) albeit of two distinctly different origins. The first asymptomatic stage is the decades-long accumulation of A\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP)-derived iA\u03b2 to the critical threshold. This triggers the activation of the self-sustaining A\u03b2PP-independent iA\u03b2 production pathway and the commencement of the second, symptomatic AD stage. Importantly, A\u03b2 produced independently of A\u03b2PP is retained intraneuronally. It drives the AD pathology and perpetuates the operation of the pathway; continuous cycles of the iA\u03b2-stimulated propagation of its own A\u03b2PP-independent production constitute an engine that drives AD, the AD Engine. It appears that the dynamics of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2 accumulation is the determining factor that either drives Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline (AACD) and triggers AD or confers the resistance to both. Within the ACH2.0 framework, the ACH-based drugs, designed to lower levels of extracellular A\u03b2, could be applicable in the prevention of AD and treatment of AACD because they reduce the rate of accumulation of A\u03b2PP-derived iA\u03b2. The present study analyzes their utility and concludes that it is severely limited. Indeed, their short-term employment is ineffective, their long-term engagement is highly problematic, their implementation at the symptomatic stages of AD is futile, and their evaluation in conventional clinical trials for the prevention of AD is impractical at best, impossible at worst, and misleading in between. In contrast, the ACH2.0-guided Next Generation Therapeutic Strategy for the treatment and prevention of both AD and AACD, namely the depletion of iA\u03b2 via its transient, short-duration, targeted degradation by the novel ACH2.0-based drugs, has none of the shortcomings of the ACH-based drugs. It is potentially highly effective, easily evaluable in clinical trials, and opens up the possibility of once-in-a-lifetime-only therapeutic intervention for prevention and treatment of both conditions. It also identifies two plausible ACH2.0-based drugs: activators of physiologically occurring intra-iA\u03b2-cleaving capabilities of BACE1 and/or BACE2.",

Subsequent research highlighted the roles of A\u03b2 peptides and tau proteins, which are the primary constituents of these lesions, which led to the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Technological advances, such as PET scans using Florbetapir, have made it possible to visualize amyloid plaques in living patients, thus improving AD's risk assessment. The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association introduced biological diagnostic criteria in 2011, which underlined the amyloid deposits diagnostic value. However, potential confirmation bias may have led researchers to over-rely on amyloid markers independent of AD's symptoms, despite evidence of their limited specificity. This review provides a critical examination of the current research paradigm in AD, including, in particular, the predominant focus on amyloid and tau species in diagnostics. We discuss the potential multifaceted consequences of this approach and propose strategies to mitigate its overemphasis in the development of new biomarkers. Furthermore, our study presents comprehensive guidelines aimed at enhancing the creation of biomarkers for accurately predicting AD dementia onset. These innovations are crucial for refining patient selection processes in clinical trial enrollment and for the optimization of therapeutic strategies.

        "AbstractText": "A large body of evidence, replicated in many mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), supports the therapeutic efficacy of the oral mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTOR-Is). Our preliminary data show that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of everolimus (RAD001) soon after clinical onset greatly diminished cognitive impairment and the intracellular beta amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle load. However, RAD001 shows >90% degradation after 7 days in solution at body temperature, thus hampering the development of proper therapeutic regimens for patients. To overcome such a drawback, we developed a stable, liquid formulation of mTOR-Is by loading RAD001 into distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-polyethylene glycol 2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) micelles using the thin layer evaporation method. The formulation showed efficient encapsulation of RAD001 and a homogeneous colloidal size and stabilised RAD001, with over 95% of activity preserved after 14 days at 37 \u00b0C with a total decay only occurring after 98 days. RAD001-loaded DSPE-PEG2000 micelles were unchanged when stored at 4 and 25 \u00b0C over the time period investigated. The obtained formulation may represent a suitable platform for expedited clinical translation and effective therapeutic regimens in AD and other neurological diseases.",

Additionally, we explored the connection between baseline plasma concentration of NfL and AD dementia patients, considering their demographics, clinical features, and cognitive profiles. A total of 350 participants from the Biomarker of AmyLoid pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk (BALTAZAR) multicenter prospective study were investigated: 161 AD dementia participants and 189 MCI participants (of which 141 had amnestic MCI and 48 non-amnestic MCI). Plasma biomarkers were measured at baseline and the progression of clinical and cognitive profiles was followed over the three years of follow-up. Baseline plasma NfL concentration increased across the Alzheimer's disease continuum with a mean NfL value of 17.1 ng/mL [SD = 6.1] in non-amnestic MCI, 20.7 ng/mL [SD = 12.0] in amnestic MCI, and 23.1 ng/mL [SD = 22.7] in AD dementia patients. Plasma NfL concentration correlated with age, body mass index (BMI), and global cognitive performance and decline, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). MMSE scores decreased in parallel with increasing plasma NfL concentration, independently of age and BMI. However, NfL concentration did not predict MCI participants' conversion to dementia within three years. Discussion: Baseline plasma NfL concentration is associated with cognitive status along the AD continuum, suggesting its usefulness as a potential informative biomarker for cognitive decline follow-up in patients.",

Recent research has demonstrated that plant miRNAs exert cross-kingdom regulation on the target genes in animals. Gastrodia elata (G. elata) is a valuable traditional Chinese medicine that has significant pharmacological activity against diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Our previous studies have indicated that G. elata-specific miRNA plays a cross-kingdom regulatory role for the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in mice. In this study, further bioinformatics analysis suggested that Gas-miR36-5p targets GSK-3\u03b2. Through western blot, RT-qPCR, and assessments of T-AOC, SOD, and MDA levels, Gas-miR36-5p demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in an AD cell model. Furthermore, Gas-miR36-5p was detected in the murine brain tissues. The results of the Morris water maze test and western blot analysis provided positive evidence for reversing the learning deficits and hyperphosphorylation of Tau in AD mice, elucidating significant neuroprotective effects in an AD model following G. elata RNA administration. Our research emphasizes Gas-miR36-5p as a novel G. elata-specific miRNA with neuroprotective properties in Alzheimer's disease by targeting GSK-3\u03b2. Consequently, our findings provide valuable insights into the cross-kingdom regulatory mechanisms underlying G. elata-specific miRNA, presenting a novel perspective for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Although current Alzheimer's disease treatments can alleviate symptoms, they cannot prevent the disease from progressing. To accurately diagnose and treat Alzheimer's disease, it is therefore necessary to establish effective methods for diagnosis. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the most frequent genetic risk factor for AD, is expressed in more than half of patients with AD, making it an attractive target for AD therapy. We used molecular docking simulations, classical molecular mechanics optimizations, and ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations to investigate the specific interactions between ApoE4 and the naturally occurring compounds found in the plant Moringa Oleifera. According to the FMO calculations, quercetin had the highest binding affinity to ApoE4 among the sixteen compounds because its hydroxyl groups generated strong hydrogen bonds with the ApoE4 residues Trp11, Asp12, Arg15, and Asp130. As a result, we proposed various quercetin derivatives by introducing a hydroxyl group into quercetin and studied their ApoE4 binding properties. The FMO data clearly showed that adding a hydroxyl group to quercetin improved its binding capacity to ApoE4. Furthermore, ApoE4 Trp11, Asp12, Arg15, and Asp130 residues were discovered to be required for significant interactions between ApoE4 and quercetin derivatives. They had a higher ApoE4 binding affinity than our previously proposed epicatechin derivatives. Accordingly, the current results evaluated using the ab initio FMO method will be useful for designing potent ApoE4 inhibitors that can be used as a candidate agent for AD treatment.",

Palmatine, one of the main components of Huangteng, the rattan stem of Fibraurea recisa Pierre (Menispermaceae), has potential in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of palmatine on amyloid beta protein 25-35-induced rat pheochromocytoma cells and AD mice and to investigate its mechanism of action. CCK8 assays, ELISA, the Morris water maze assay, fluorescent probes, calcein/PI staining, immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analysis were used. The experimental results show that palmatine can increase the survival rate of A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cells and mouse hippocampal neurons, reduce apoptosis, reduce the content of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, GSH, SOD, MDA and ROS, improve the learning and memory ability of AD mice, inhibit the expression of Keap-1 and Bax, and promote the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and Bcl-2. We conclude that palmatine can ameliorate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation produced by A\u03b225-35-induced PC12 cells and mice by modulating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that palmatine may have a potential therapeutic effect on AD and could be further investigated as a promising therapeutic agent for AD.

For sporadic Alzheimer's disease, age per se is one of the most relevant risk factors, but frailty has also been associated with this disease. Therefore, we aimed to answer the two following questions within a cross-sectional study: (1) do Alzheimer's model mice show increased frailty, and (2) what changes of the microbiota occur concerning chronological age or frailty? Indeed, aged 5xFAD mice showed increased frailty compared to wild type littermates. In addition, 5xFAD mice had significantly lower quantities of Bacteroides spp. when only considering frailty, and lower levels of Bacteroidetes in terms of both frailty and chronological age compared to their wild type littermates.

Currently, there is no cure for AD with drug therapy.

Leveraging deep learning principles, we harnessed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as our classifier for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction. Our approach involved the utilization of a seven-layer CNN with diverse configurations to process the dataset. Empirical outcomes on the AD dataset underscored the effectiveness of the PCA-CNN model, yielding an accuracy of 96.60% and a loss of 0.3503. Likewise, the SVD-CNN model showcased remarkable accuracy, attaining 97.08% and a loss of 0.2466. These results accentuate the potential of our method for gene dimension reduction and classification accuracy enhancement by selecting a subset of pertinent genes. Integrating gene selection methodologies with deep learning architectures presents a promising framework for elevating AD prediction and promoting precision medicine in neurodegenerative disorders. Ongoing research endeavors aim to generalize this approach for diverse applications, explore alternative gene selection techniques, and investigate a variety of deep learning architectures.",

        "AbstractText": "In the early stages of Alzheimer-Perusini's disease (AD), individuals often experience vision-related issues such as color vision impairment, reduced contrast sensitivity, and visual acuity problems. As the disease progresses, there is a connection with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading to retinal cell death. The retina's involvement suggests a link with the hippocampus, where most AD forms start. A thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) due to the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is seen as a potential AD diagnostic marker using electroretinography (ERG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Amyloid beta fragments (A\u03b2), found in the eye's vitreous and aqueous humor, are also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and accumulate in the retina. A\u03b2 is known to cause tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to its buildup in various retinal layers. However, diseases like AD are now seen as mixed proteinopathies, with deposits of the prion protein (PrP) and \u03b1-synuclein found in affected brains and retinas. Glial cells, especially microglial cells, play a crucial role in these diseases, maintaining immunoproteostasis. Studies have shown similarities between retinal and brain microglia in terms of transcription factor expression and morphotypes. All these findings constitute a good start to achieving better comprehension of neurodegeneration in both the eye and the brain. New insights will be able to bring the scientific community closer to specific disease-modifying therapies.",

        "AbstractText": "The overweight status or obesity can be confirmed through classical methods such as the body mass index (BMI) and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Apart from metabolic issues such as atherosclerosis, liver steatosis, or diabetes mellitus, long-term obesity or overweight status can pose a risk for cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. While some acute adverse events like coronary syndromes of strokes are well-documented to be linked to an increased body mass, there are also chronic processes that, due to their silent onset and evolution, are underdiagnosed and not as thoroughly studied. Through this review, we aimed to collect all relevant data with regard to the long-term impact of obesity on cognitive function in all ages and its correlation with an earlier onset of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The exact mechanisms through which a decline in cognitive functions occurs in overweight or obese persons are still being discussed. A combination of factors has been acknowledged as potential triggers, such as a sedentary lifestyle and stress, as well as a genetic predisposition, for example, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles in AD. Most research highlights the impact of vascular dysfunction and systemic inflammation on the nervous system in patients with obesity and the subsequent neurological changes. Obesity during the early to mid-ages leads to an earlier onset of cognitive dysfunction in various forms. Also, lifestyle intervention can reverse cognitive dysfunction, especially dieting, to encourage weight loss.",

Tau and A\u03b2 complexes spread from the entorhinal cortex of the brain to interconnected regions, where they bind pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia to trigger inflammation and neurotoxicity that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration and clinical AD. Systemic inflammation is initiated by A\u03b2's egress into the circulation, which may be secondary to microglial activation and can confer both destructive and reparative actions. Microglial activation pathways and downstream drivers of A\u03b2/NFT neurotoxicity, including inflammatory regulators, are primary targets for AD therapy. Osteopontin (OPN), an inflammatory cytokine and biomarker of AD, is implicated in A\u03b2 clearance and toxicity, microglial activation, and inflammation, and is considered to be a potential therapeutic target. Here, using the most relevant works from the literature, we review and contextualize the evidence for a central role of OPN and associated inflammation in AD.",

Recent studies have illuminated the pathophysiology of gout/hyperuricemia and its epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and complications. The genetic involvement of urate transporters and enzymes is also proven. URAT1, a molecular therapeutic target for gout/hyperuricemia, was initially derived from research into hereditary renal hypouricemia (RHUC). RHUC is often accompanied by complications such as exercise-induced acute kidney injury, which indicates the key physiological role of uric acid. Several studies have also revealed its physiological role as both an anti-oxidant and a pro-oxidant, acting as both a scavenger and a generator of reactive oxygen species (ROSs). These discoveries have prompted research interest in SU and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), an enzyme that produces both urate and ROSs, as status or progression biomarkers of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. The notion of \"the lower, the better\" is therefore incorrect; a better understanding of uric acid handling and metabolism/transport comes from an awareness that excessively high and low levels both cause problems. We summarize here the current body of evidence, demonstrate that uric acid is much more than a metabolic waste product, and finally propose the novel disease concept of \"dysuricemia\" on the path toward \"normouricemia\", or optimal SU level, to take advantage of the dual roles of uric acid. Our proposal should help to interpret the spectrum from hypouricemia to hyperuricemia/gout as a single disease category.",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the neuropathological and clinical features of CTE, proposed biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both research and clinical settings, and a range of treatments based on previous preclinical and clinical research studies. Due to the heterogeneity of TBI, there is no universally agreed-upon serum, CSF, or neuroimaging marker for its diagnosis. However, as our understanding of this complex disease continues to evolve, it is likely that there will be more robust, early diagnostic methods and effective clinical treatments. This is especially important given the increasing evidence of a correlation between TBI and neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and CTE.

Twelve participants were in the ACT group in which a motor assisted their cycling to be performed at least 30% faster than voluntary cycling (VC), 10 participants were in the voluntary cycling group, and two participants were in the no cycling (NC) group. The results showed that both exercise groups (i.e., ACT and VC) improved in their self-efficacy after the 8-week intervention. In addition, exercise perception improved following ACT, but not VC or NC. Our results are discussed with respect to their future implications for exercise in the DS population. The results can be attributed to differences in effort required by each intervention group as well as the neurotrophic factors that occur when muscle contractions create synaptic connections resulting in improvement in cognition and feelings of satisfaction.",

Co-exposure to arsenic and alcohol can occur because an individual with an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is exposed to arsenic in their drinking water or food or because of arsenic found directly in alcoholic beverages. This study aims to determine if co-exposure to alcohol and arsenic leads to worse outcomes in neurodegeneration and associated mechanisms that could lead to cell death. To study this, mice were exposed to a 10-day gavage model of alcohol-induced neurodegeneration with varying doses of arsenic (0, 0.005, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg). The following were examined after the last dose of ethanol: (1) microglia activation assessed via immunohistochemical detection of Iba-1, (2) reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) using a colorimetric assay, (3) neurodegeneration using Fluoro-Jade\u00ae C staining (FJC), and 4) arsenic absorption using ICP-MS. After exposure, there was an additive effect of the highest dose of arsenic (10 mg/kg) in the dentate gyrus of alcohol-induced FJC+ cells. This additional cell loss may have been due to the observed increase in microglial reactivity or increased arsenic absorption following co-exposure to ethanol and arsenic. The data also showed that arsenic caused an increase in CYP2E1 expression and ROS/RNS production in the hippocampus which could have independently contributed to increased neurodegeneration. Altogether, these findings suggest a potential cyclical impact of co-exposure to arsenic and ethanol as ethanol increases arsenic absorption but arsenic also enhances alcohol's deleterious effects in the CNS.",

These processes are based on the separation of biopolymers into phases regulated by multiple specific and nonspecific inter- and intramolecular interactions. Among the realm of MLOs, a special place is taken by the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs or PML bodies), which are the intranuclear compartments involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism, transcription, the maintenance of genome stability, responses to viral infection, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. According to the accepted models, specific interactions, such as SUMO/SIM, the formation of disulfide bonds, etc., play a decisive role in the biogenesis of PML bodies. In this work, a number of bioinformatics approaches were used to study proteins found in the proteome of PML bodies for their tendency for spontaneous liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is usually caused by weak nonspecific interactions. A total of 205 proteins found in PML bodies have been identified. It has been suggested that UBC9, P53, HIPK2, and SUMO1 can be considered as the scaffold proteins of PML bodies. It was shown that more than half of the proteins in the analyzed proteome are capable of spontaneous LLPS, with 85% of the analyzed proteins being intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and the remaining 15% being proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). About 44% of all proteins analyzed in this study contain SUMO binding sites and can potentially be SUMOylated.

For this reason, maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and proteostasis (homeostasis of the proteome) is essential for cellular health. Therefore, there are different mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs), mitophagy, or mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR). The last item is a stress response that occurs when stress is present within mitochondria and, especially, when the accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix surpasses the folding capacity of the mitochondrion. In response to this, molecular chaperones and proteases as well as the mitochondrial antioxidant system are activated to restore mitochondrial proteostasis and cellular function. In disease contexts, mtUPR modulation holds therapeutic potential by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction. In particular, in the case of neurodegenerative diseases, such as primary mitochondrial diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), or Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), there is a wealth of evidence demonstrating that the modulation of mtUPR helps to reduce neurodegeneration and its associated symptoms in various cellular and animal models.

Amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases might be the risk factors for developing AD. The present study examines the acute effects of soluble A\u03b2 on the function of NMDA receptors in rats RVLM. We used the magnitude of increases in the blood pressure (pressor responses) induced by microinjection of NMDA into the RVLM as an index of NMDA receptor function in the RVLM. Soluble A\u03b2 was applied by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. A\u03b21-40 at a lower dose (0.2 nmol) caused a slight reduction, and a higher dose (2 nmol) showed a significant decrease in NMDA-induced pressor responses 10 min after administration. ICV injection of A\u03b21-42 (2 nmol) did not affect NMDA-induced pressor responses in the RVLM. Co-administration of A\u03b21-40 with ifenprodil or memantine blocked the inhibitory effects of A\u03b21-40. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase in the immunoreactivity of phosphoserine 1480 of GluN2B subunits (pGluN2B-serine1480) in the neuron of the RVLM without significant changes in phosphoserine 896 of GluN1 subunits (pGluN1-serine896), GluN1 and GluN2B, 10 min following A\u03b21-40 administration compared with saline. Interestingly, we found a much higher level of A\u03b21-40 compared to that of A\u03b21-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 10 min following ICV administration of the same dose (2 nmol) of the peptides. In conclusion, the results suggest that ICV A\u03b21-40, but not A\u03b21-42, produced an inhibitory effect on NMDA receptor function in the RVLM, which might result from changes in pGluN2B-serine1480 (regulated by casein kinase II).

Here, we have delved into the mechanism of action, eliminating alternative pathways as putative mechanisms. Furthermore, we have identified that BPL1\u2122, its heat treated form (BPL1\u2122 HT) and its LTA prolong longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) in an insulin/IGF-1-dependent mechanism, and its consumption improves the oxidative stress response, gut permeability and protection against pathogenic infections. Furthermore, positive effects on C. elegans stress-related behaviors and in the Alzheimer's Disease model were found, highlighting the potential of the strain in improving the cognitive functions and proteotoxicity in the nematode. These results indicate the pivotal role of the IGF-1 pathway in the activity of the strain and pave the way for potential applications of BPL1\u2122, BPL1\u2122 HT and its LTA in the field of longevity and age-related markers.",

Due to the complexity of the disease, current therapeutic strategies aim at a multitargeted approach, often relying on a combination of substances with versatile and complementary effects. In the present study, a unique combination of \u03b1-lipoic acid, citicoline, extracts of leaves from olive tree and green tea, vitamin D3, selenium and an immune-supporting complex was tested in scopolamine-induced dementia in rats. Using behavioral and biochemical methods, we assessed the effects of the combination on learning and memory, and elucidated the mechanisms of these effects. Our results showed that, compared to its components, the experimental combination was most efficient in improving short- and long-term memory as assessed by the step-through method as well as spatial memory as assessed by T-maze and Barnes maze underlined by decreases in AChE activity (p < 0.05) and LPO (p < 0.001), increases in SOD activity in the cortex (p < 0.05) and increases in catalase (p < 0.05) and GPx (p < 0.01) activities and BDNF (p < 0.001) and pCREB (p < 0.05) levels in the hippocampus. No significant histopathological changes or blood parameter changes were detected, making the experimental combination an effective and safe candidate in a multitargeted treatment of AD.",

The most common NDs are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, in which cholinergic and dopaminergic systems are impaired, respectively. Despite different brain regions being affected, oxidative stress and inflammation were found to be common triggers in the pathogenesis and progression of both diseases. By taking advantage of a multi-target approach, in this work we explored alkyl substituted coumarins as neuroprotective agents, capable to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation by inhibiting enzymes involved in neurodegeneration, among which are Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs), Monoamine Oxidases (MAOs), and Cholinesterases (ChEs). The compounds were synthesized and profiled against the three targeted enzymes. The binding mode of the most promising compounds (7 and 9) within MAO-A and -B was analyzed through molecular modeling studies, providing and explanation for the different selectivities observed for the MAO isoforms. In vitro biological studies using LPS-stimulated rat astrocytes showed that some compounds were able to counteract the oxidative stress-induced neuroinflammation and hamper interleukin-6 secretion, confirming the success of this multitarget approach.",

Herein, we aim to illustrate the effect of the Wnt target genes on the cortical volumes of AD patients. 82 sporadic AD patients were recruited. All the subjects had history survey, blood biochemical examination, cognitive assessment, MRI morphometry and whole exome sequencing. This report focused on 84 common variants (minor allele frequency\u2009>\u20090.01) of 32 Wnt target genes, including the APC, DAAM1, DACT1, DISC1, LATS2, TLR2, WDR61, and the AXIN, DVL, FZD, LRP, TCF/LEF, WNT family genes. The Wnt target genes showed asymmetric effects on the cortical volumes of AD patients. The right temporal/parietal/occipital cortices were more affected than left temporal/parietal/occipital cortices. Nevertheless, the reverse applied to the frontal cortex. The DACT1 affected the cortical thickness most, followed by the TCF3 and APC. The DACT1 rs698025-GG genotype displayed greater right temporal pole and left medial orbito-frontal gyrus than rs698025-GA genotype (2.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 vs. 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6, P\u2009=\u20090.005; 5.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6 vs. 5.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6, P\u2009=\u20090.001).

Of these, Alzheimer's disease, leading to cognitive dysfunction, is of particular interest. Neuronal loss plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this condition, and over the years, a great effort has been made to determine the role of various factors in this process. Unfortunately, until now, the exact pathomechanism of this condition remains unknown. However, the most popular theories associate AD with abnormalities in the Tau and \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) proteins, which lead to their deposition and result in neuronal death. Neurons, like all cells, die in a variety of ways, among which pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are associated with the activation of various caspases. It is worth mentioning that Tau and A\u03b2 proteins are considered to be one of the caspase activators, leading to cell death. Moreover, the protease activity of caspases influences both of the previously mentioned proteins, Tau and A\u03b2, converting them into more toxic derivatives. Due to the variety of ways caspases impact the development of AD, drugs targeting caspases could potentially be useful in the treatment of this condition. Therefore, there is a constant need to search for novel caspase inhibitors and evaluate them in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Using ABCA7 knockout human iPSC models generated with CRISPR/Cas9, we investigated the impacts of ABCA7 deficiency on neuronal metabolism and function. Lipidomics revealed that mitochondria-related phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin were reduced in the ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived cortical organoids. Consistently, ABCA7 deficiency-induced alterations of mitochondrial morphology accompanied by reduced ATP synthase activity and exacerbated oxidative damage in the organoids. Furthermore, ABCA7-deficient iPSC-derived neurons showed compromised mitochondrial respiration and excess ROS generation, as well as enlarged mitochondrial morphology compared to the isogenic controls. ABCA7 deficiency also decreased spontaneous synaptic firing and network formation in iPSC-derived neurons, in which the effects were rescued by supplementation with phosphatidylglycerol or NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide. Importantly, effects of ABCA7 deficiency on mitochondria morphology and synapses were recapitulated in synaptosomes isolated from the brain of neuron-specific Abca7 knockout mice.

The dysregulation of these PTMs is related to aberrant cell cycle in neurons, which is one of the factors involved in neurodegenerative pathologies. Moreover, the effect of exogenous activation of CDKs and CDK inhibitors through PTMs on the signaling cascade was studied in postmitotic conditions of NDDs. Furthermore, the therapeutic implications of CDK inhibitors and associated alteration in PTMs were discussed.

To better investigate the potential effects of these mutations, we compared the clinical, and neuroimaging characteristics of these two patients to 20 randomly selected patients with PSP-RS without a MAPT mutation.

CCTs derived from 2 classification approaches loaded onto 4 factors: memory, attention-concentration (AC), temporal orientation, and praxis. Memory contained complaints about both memory and executive functioning. AC contained both classifications of AC complaints. Complaints about AC (AC1 and AC2) differed by diagnostic group (all P < 0.05).

However, transitioning to the community after discharge from home health presents challenges to patient safety and quality of life. The severity of an individual's functional impairments, cognitive limitations, and behavioral and psychological symptoms may compound these challenges. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between dementia severity and successful discharge to community (DTC) from home health. This was a retrospective study of 142 376 Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. Successful DTC was defined as having no unplanned hospitalization or death within 30 days of DTC from home health. Successful DTC rates were calculated, and multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of successful DTC, by dementia severity category, adjusted for patient and clinical characteristics. Six dementia severity categories were identified using a crosswalk between items on the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and the Functional Assessment Staging Tool. Successful DTC occurred in 71.2% of beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in the 2 most severe dementia categories had significantly lower risk of successful DTC (category 6: RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.889-0.910; category 7: RR = 0.737, 95% CI = 0.704-0.770) than those in the least severe dementia category. The RR of successful DTC for people with ADRD decreased as the level of independence with oral medication management decreased and when there was an overall greater need for caregiver assistance. Patient status at the time of admission to home health is associated with outcomes after discharge from home health. Early identification of people in advanced stages of ADRD provides an opportunity to implement strategies to facilitate successful DTC while people are still receiving home care services. The severity of ADRD and availability of caregiver assistance should be key considerations in planning for successful DTC for people with ADRD.",

The investigation of the involvement of cerebral small veins in the advancement of AD has yet to be sufficiently explored in previous studies, primarily due to constraints associated with pathological staining techniques. However, recent research has provided valuable insights into multiple pathophysiological occurrences concerning cerebral small veins in AD, which may manifest sequentially, concurrently, or in a self-perpetuating manner. These events are presumed to be among the initial processes in the disease's progression. The impact of cerebral small vein loss on amyloid beta (A\u03b2) clearance through the glial lymphatic system is noteworthy. There exists a potential interdependence between collagen deposition and A\u03b2 deposition in cerebral small veins. The compromised functionality of cerebral small veins can result in decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, potentially leading to cerebral tissue ischemia and edema. Additionally, the reduction of cerebral small veins may facilitate the infiltration of inflammatory factors into the brain parenchyma, thereby eliciting neuroinflammatory responses. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a valuable modality for the efficient assessment of cerebral small veins, precisely the deep medullary vein (DMV), and holds promise for the identification of precise and reliable imaging biomarkers for AD.

Competition binding assays with [3H]-l-deprenyl and [3H]-BU99008 versus unlabeled SMBT-1 in postmortem AD and CN temporal and frontal cortex brains demonstrated that SMBT-1 interacted with [3H]-deprenyl at a single binding site (nM range) and with [3H]-BU99008 at multiple binding sites (from nM to \u03bcM).

The association of TDP-43 proteinopathy with AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and its impact on specific cognitive domains are not fully understood and whether loss of TDP-43 function occurs early in the aging brain remains unknown. Here, using a large set of autopsies from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and another younger cohort, we were able to study brains from subjects 21-109\u00a0years of age. Examination of these brains show that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression, as judged by TDP-43 nuclear clearance and expression of a cryptic exon in HDGFL2, first occurs during the 6th decade, preceding by a decade the appearance of TDP-43+\u2009neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs). We corroborated this observation using a monoclonal antibody to demonstrate a cryptic exon-encoded neoepitope within HDGFL2 in neurons exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. TDP-43 nuclear clearance is associated with increased burden of tau pathology. Age at death, female sex, high CERAD neuritic plaque score, and high Braak neurofibrillary stage significantly increase the odds of LATE-NC. Faster rates of cognitive decline on verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test immediate recall), visuospatial ability (Card Rotations Test), mental status (MMSE) and semantic fluency (Category Fluency Test) were associated with LATE-NC. Notably, the effects of LATE-NC on verbal memory and visuospatial ability are independent of ADNC. However, the effects of TDP-43 nuclear clearance in absence of NCI on the longitudinal trajectories and levels of cognitive measures are not significant. These results establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression is an early event occurring in the aging population during the development of TDP-43 proteinopathy and is associated with increased tau pathology. Furthermore, LATE-NC correlates with high levels of ADNC but also has an impact on specific memory and visuospatial functions in aging that is independent of AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Huperzine A (HupA) is an important drug for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is primarily extracted from the Huperzia serrata (Lycopodiaceae). Failures in the chemical synthesis of Hup and in vitro culture have put H. serrata in danger of extinction, and there is a need for an extensive investigation of Hup from alternative perspectives. The aim of this study is to identify endophytic fungi that produce high Hup or simultaneously produce many types of Hup and have high genetic stability derived from other Lycopodiaceae species as a source of materials for natural Hup production. In this work, Hup-producing endophytic fungi were isolated from three species: Lycopodium clavatum, Phlegmariurus squarrosus, and P. phlegmaria. Of these, L. clavatum and P. squarrosus were confirmed as novel sources of Hup-producing fungi. Based on morphological characteristics and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS sequences, four endophytic fungi Colletotrichum siamense THG1-17, Epicoccum sorghinum THG01-18, Phoma sp. TKH3-2, and Phyllosticta sp. THG2-27 were firstly isolated from these Lycopodiaceae plants, which were capable of simultaneously producing both HupA and HupB, as evidenced by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The four strains showed stability in Hup yield over 50 generations of culture with an in vitro storage period of 3 months. These isolated fungi will provide a new source of materials for further research to develop drugs containing HupA as well as HupB for AD treatment in the future.",

        "AbstractText": "Surface engineering of nanoparticles has been widely used in biosensing and assays, where sensitivity was mainly limited by plasmonic colour change or electrochemical responses. Here, we report a novel biomimetic sensing strategy involving protein-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), where the modulation strategy was inspired by gastropods in inhibition of coffee-ring effects in their trail-followings. The so-called coffee-ring effect presents the molecular behaviour of AuNPs to a macroscopic ring through aggregation, and thus greatly improves sensitivity. The assay relies upon the different assembly patterns of AuNPs against analytes, resulting in the formation or suppression of coffee-ring effects by the different surface engineering of AuNPs by proteins and peptides. The mechanism of the coffee-ring formation process is examined through experimental characterizations and computational simulations. A practical coffee-ring effect assay is developed for a proof-of-concept target, amyloid \u03b2 (1-42), which is a typical biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. A novel quasi-titrimetric protocol is constructed for quantitative determination of the target molecule. The assay shows excellent selectivity and sensitivity for the amyloid \u03b2 monomer, with a low detection limit of 20 pM. Combined with a fluorescent staining technique, the assay is designed as a smart sensor for amyloid \u03b2 detection and fibrillation evaluation in rat cerebrospinal fluids, which is a potential point-of-care test for Alzheimer's disease. Connections between amyloid fibrillation and different courses of brain ischaemia are also studied, with improved sensitivity, lower sample volumes that are required, convenience for rapid detection, and point-of-care testing.",

        "AbstractText": "We had attended a Parkinson's Disease (PD) patient for a non-healing wound who reported a marked decrease in his hand tremor and freezing of gait when his wound was exposed to a ceramic far-field infrared (cFIR) blanket. PD is the most frequent motor disorder and the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) affect up to 10 million people throughout the world, and the major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of PD is the accumulation and propagation of pathological \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-Syn) and the death of dopaminergic cells in the Nigrostriatal system. Efforts to slow or stop its spreading have resulted in the development and use of dopaminergic drug replacement therapy. Unfortunately, there is a loss of about 70-80% of substantia nigral dopaminergic neurons in patients by the time they are diagnosed with PD, and various dopaminergic drugs provide only temporary relief of their motor symptoms. There are limitations in treating PD with many conventional medications, necessitating a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmacological therapy as an essential adjunct to better address the health and welfare of PD patients. We used male adult A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to a ceramic far-infrared blanket. Motor activity was assessed using the rotarod apparatus, and mouse brains were examined to quantify the fluorescence intensities of the immunostained samples. A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice had a significantly shorter time stay on the rotating bar than the wild-type mice (B6C3H). The rotarod performance was significantly improved in A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic mice exposed to cFIR as well as B6C3H healthy wild mice exposed to cFIR. There was a significant statistical and substantive increase in the cellular composition of the Striatum and substantia nigra of cFIR-treated mice. Improvement in motor performance is seen in PD mice and wild mice and is associated with increases in cell volume in the substantia nigra and striatum after treatment.",

        "AbstractText": "Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition within the brain vasculature is an early hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which triggers loss of brain vascular smooth muscle cells (BVSMCs) in cerebral arteries, via poorly understood mechanisms, altering cerebral blood flow, brain waste clearance, and promoting cognitive impairment. We have previously shown that, in brain endothelial cells (ECs), vasculotropic A\u03b2 species induce apoptosis through death receptors (DRs) DR4 and DR5 and mitochondria-mediated mechanisms, while FDA-approved carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) prevent mitochondria-mediated EC apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we analyzed A\u03b2-induced extrinsic and intrinsic (DR- and mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic pathways in BVSMC, aiming to unveil new therapeutic targets to prevent BVSMC stress and death. We show that both apoptotic pathways are activated in BVSMCs by oligomeric A\u03b242 and A\u03b240-Q22 (A\u03b2Q22) and mitochondrial respiration is severely impaired. Importantly, the CAIs methazolamide (MTZ) and acetazolamide (ATZ) prevent the pro-apoptotic effects in BVSMCs, while reducing caspase 3 activation and A\u03b2 deposition in the arterial walls of TgSwDI animals, a murine model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).

We aim to emphasize microglial signatures in physiologic brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A systematic literature search of all published articles about microglial senescence in human healthy aging and AD was performed, searching for PubMed and Scopus online databases. Among 1947 articles screened, a total of 289 articles were assessed for full-text eligibility. Microglial transcriptomic, phenotypic, and neuropathological profiles were analyzed comprising healthy aging and AD. Our review highlights that studies on animal models only partially clarify what happens in humans. Human and mice microglia are hugely heterogeneous. Like a two-sided coin, microglia can be protective or harmful, depending on the context. Brain health depends upon a balance between the actions and reactions of microglia maintaining brain homeostasis in cooperation with other cell types (especially astrocytes and oligodendrocytes). During aging, accumulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction weaken microglia leading to dystrophic/senescent, otherwise over-reactive, phenotype-enhancing neurodegenerative phenomena. Microglia are crucial for managing A\u03b2, pTAU, and damaged synapses, being pivotal in AD pathogenesis.",

Endogenous CHCHD10 levels decline in the brains of ALS-FTD patients, and the CHCHD10S59L mutation in Drosophila induces dominant toxicity together with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a protein critical for the induction of mitophagy. However, whether and how CHCHD10 variants regulate mitophagy flux in the mammalian brain is unknown. Here, we demonstrate through in vivo and in vitro models, as well as human FTD brain tissue, that ALS/FTD-linked CHCHD10 mutations (R15L and S59L) impair mitophagy flux and mitochondrial Parkin recruitment, whereas wild-type CHCHD10 (CHCHD10WT) normally enhances these measures. Specifically, we show that CHCHD10R15L and CHCHD10S59L mutations reduce PINK1 levels by increasing PARL activity, whereas CHCHD10WT produces the opposite results through its stronger interaction with PARL, suppressing its activity. Importantly, we also demonstrate that FTD brains with TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) pathology demonstrate disruption of the PARL-PINK1 pathway and that experimentally impairing mitophagy promotes TDP-43 aggregation. Thus, we provide herein new insights into the regulation of mitophagy and TDP-43 aggregation in the mammalian brain through the CHCHD10-PARL-PINK1 pathway.",

Depression is one of the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, and clinical evidence demonstrates that depressive symptoms accelerate the cognitive deficit of AD patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of depressive symptoms present in the process of AD remain unclear. Depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline in hTau mice were induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). Computational prediction and molecular experiments supported that an asparagine endopeptidase (AEP)-derived Tau fragment, Tau N368 interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-\u03b4). Further behavioral studies investigated the role of Tau N368-PPAR-\u03b4 interaction in depressive-like behaviors and cognitive declines of AD models exposed to CRS. We found that mitochondrial dysfunction was positively associated with depressive-like behaviors and cognitive deficits in hTau mice. Chronic stress increased Tau N368 and promoted the interaction of Tau N368 with PPAR-\u03b4, repressing PPAR-\u03b4-mediated transactivation in the hippocampus of mice. Then we predicted and identified the binding sites of PPAR-\u03b4. Finally, inhibition of AEP, clearance of Tau N368 and pharmacological activation of PPAR-\u03b4 effectively alleviated CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline in mice. These results demonstrate that Tau N368 in the hippocampus impairs mitochondrial function by suppressing PPAR-\u03b4, facilitating the occurrence of depressive-like behaviors and cognitive decline.

The estimated normative model is then applied on AD patients to quantify the deviation in brain volumes and identify abnormal brain pattern deviations due to the progressive stages of AD. We compared our proposed mmVAE with a baseline unimodal VAE having a single encoder and decoder and the two modalities concatenated as unimodal input. Our experimental results show that deviation maps generated by mmVAE are more sensitive to disease staging within AD, have a better correlation with patient cognition and result in higher number of brain regions with statistically significant deviations compared to the unimodal baseline model.",

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative neurological illness with insidious onset. Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of AD and different pathological changes, the clinical phenotypes of dementia are diverse, and these pathological changes also interact with each other. Therefore, it is of great significance to search for biomarkers that can diagnose these pathological changes to improve the ability to monitor the course of disease and treat the disease. The pathological mechanism hypothesis with high recognition of AD mainly includes the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) around neurons and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which results in the development of neuronal fiber tangles (NFTs) and mitochondrial dysfunction. AD is an irreversible disease; currently, there is no clinical cure or delay in the disease process of drugs, and there is a lack of effective early clinical diagnosis methods. AD patients, often in the dementia stages and moderate cognitive impairment, will seek medical treatment. Biomarkers can help diagnose the presence or absence of specific diseases and their pathological processes, so early screening and diagnosis are crucial for the prevention and therapy of AD in clinical practice. \u03b2-amyloid deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration/neuronal damage (N), also known as the AT (N) biomarkers system, are widely validated core humoral markers for the diagnosis of AD. In this paper, the pathogenesis of AD related to AT (N) and the current research status of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood related biomarkers were reviewed. At the same time, the limitations of humoral markers in the diagnosis of AD were also discussed, and the future development of humoral markers for AD was prospected. In addition, the contents related to mitochondrial dysfunction, prion virology and intestinal microbiome related to AD are also described, so as to understand the pathogenesis of AD in many aspects and dimensions, so as to evaluate the pathological changes related to AD more comprehensively and accurately.",

The patient underwent routine laboratory tests, neuropsychological assessments, and neuroimaging examinations. Additionally, the cerebrospinal fluid sample was analyzed for AD biomarkers using the Single Molecular Array (Simoa) technique. A targeted Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) panel screening was also conducted. Routine blood and CSF laboratory tests, as well as CSF tap test, yielded negative results. Cranial MRI showed atrophy of the whole brain. PiB-PET scanning indicated that PiB was merely retained in her brain with an overall standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) <1.0.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive memory loss and cognitive dysfunction brain disorder brought on by the dysfunctional amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and clearance of APP peptides. Increased APP levels lead to the production of AD-related peptides including the amyloid APP intracellular domain (AICD) and amyloid beta (A\u03b2), and consequently modify the intrinsic excitability of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, synaptic protein activity, and impair synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA1-CA3 synapses. The goal of the present study is to build computational models that incorporate the effect of AD-related peptides on CA1 pyramidal neuron and hippocampal synaptic plasticity under the AD conditions and investigate the potential pharmacological treatments that could normalize hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning in AD. We employ a phenomenological N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-based voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity model that includes the separate receptor contributions on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) and embed it into the a detailed compartmental model of CA1 pyramidal neuron. Modeling results show that partial blockade of Glu2NB-NMDAR-gated channel restores intrinsic excitability of a CA1 pyramidal neuron and rescues LTP in AICD and A\u03b2 conditions. The model provides insight into the complex interactions in AD pathophysiology and suggests the conditions under which the synchronous activation of a cluster of synaptic inputs targeting the dendritic tree of CA1 pyramidal neuron leads to restored synaptic plasticity.",

        "AbstractText": "Evidence-based interventions to protect against cognitive decline among older adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are urgently needed. Rehabilitation approaches to support memory and behavioral/lifestyle interventions are recognized as promising strategies for preserving or improving cognitive health, although few previous interventions have combined both approaches. This paper describes the protocol of the Brain Boosters intervention, which synergistically combines training in compensatory and healthy lifestyle behaviors and supports implementation and tracking of new behaviors with a digital application. The study utilizes a single-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled design to compare a structured lifestyle and compensatory aid intervention to an education-only self-guided intervention. We plan to enroll 225 community-dwelling adults (25% from underrepresented groups) aged 65\u2009+\u2009who endorse subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and low baseline levels of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Both interventions will be administered in group format, consisting of 15 two-hour classes that occur weekly for ten weeks and taper to bi-monthly and monthly, for an intervention duration of 6\u00a0months. Participants in both interventions will receive education about a variety of memory support strategies and healthy lifestyle behaviors, focusing on physical and cognitive activity and stress management. The structured intervention will also receive support in adopting new behaviors and tracking set goals aided by the Electronic Memory and Management Aid (EMMA) digital application. Primary outcomes include global cognition (composite of memory, attention, and executive function tests) and everyday function (Everyday Cognition Questionnaire). Data will be collected at baseline and outcome visits, at approximately 6, 12, and 18\u00a0months. Qualitative interviews, self-report surveys (e.g., indicators of self-determination, health literacy) and EMMA data metrics will also be used to identify what components of the intervention are most effective and for whom they work. Successful project completion will provide valuable information about how individuals with SCD respond to a compensation and preventative lifestyle intervention assisted by a digital application, including an understanding of factors that may impact outcomes, treatment uptake, and adherence. The work will also inform development, scaling, and personalization of future interventions that can delay disability in individuals at risk for ADRD. ClinicalTrials.gov.

        "AbstractText": "Neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative disorders, represented paradigmatically by glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease, respectively, persist as formidable challenges in the biomedical realm. The interconnected molecular underpinnings of these conditions necessitate rigorous and novel therapeutic examinations. This comprehensive research was anchored on the premise of unveiling the therapeutic potential and specificity of Lupenone, a potent phytoconstituent, in targeting the molecular pathways underpinning both glioblastoma and Alzheimer's amyloid beta pathology. This was gauged through its interactions with key protein structures, 5H08 and 2ZHV. An integrative approach was adopted, marrying advanced proteomics and modern computer-aided drug design techniques. Molecular docking of Lupenone with 5H08 and 2ZHV was meticulously executed, with subsequent molecular dynamics simulations providing insights into the stability, viability, and intricacies of these interactions. Lupenone demonstrated profound binding affinities, evidenced by robust docking scores of -9.54\u00a0kcal/mol for 5H08 and -10.59\u00a0kcal/mol for 2ZHV. These interactions underscored Lupenone's eminent therapeutic potential in mitigating glioblastoma and modulating the amyloid beta pathology inherent to Alzheimer's. The introduction of Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) further magnified the therapeutic prospects, accentuating Lupenone's efficacy. The findings of this study not only underscore the therapeutic acumen of Lupenone in addressing the challenges posed by glioblastoma and Alzheimer's but also lay a strong foundation for its consideration as a leading candidate in future neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative research endeavors. Given the compelling in-silico data, a clarion call is made for its empirical validation in holistic in-vivo settings, potentially pioneering a new therapeutic epoch in both glioblastoma and Alzheimer's interventions.",

Blood biomarkers are less invasive, easier to obtain and achievable by a cheaper means than those on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly more economic than functional neuroimaging investigations; thus, a great interest is focused on blood isoforms of the phosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), indicators of ongoing tau pathology (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs, an AD neuropathological hallmark) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, current data often highlight discordant results about the ability of blood pTau to predict CSF status. We aim to synthesise the studies that compared pTau levels on CSF and blood to assess their correlation in AD continuum. We performed a narrative literature review using, first, MEDLINE (via PubMed) by means of MeSH terms, and then, we expanded the reults by means of Scopus and Web of Sciences to be as inclusive as possible. Finally, we added work following an expert opinion. Only papers presenting original data on pTau values on both blood and CSF were included. The 33 included studies show an extreme heterogeneity in terms of pTau isoform (pTau181, 217 and 231), laboratory methods, diagnostic criteria and choice of comparison groups. Most studies evaluated plasma pTau181, while data on other isoforms and serum are scarcer. Most papers identify a correlation between CSF and blood measurements. Furthermore, even when not specified, it is often possible to show an increase in blood pTau values as AD-related damage progresses in the AD continuum and higher values in AD than in other neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, plasma pTau231 seems the first biomarker to look for in the earliest and pre-clinical stages, quickly followed by pTau217 and, finally, by pTau181. Our results encourage the use of blood pTau for the early identification of patients with AD continuum.",

These processes have been linked to disease progression and a decline in cognitive function. Various therapeutic approaches aim at the prevention or reduction of tau aggregates in neurons. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a very valuable tool in neuroscience discovery, as they offer access to potentially unlimited amounts of cell types that are affected in disease, including cortical neurons, for in vitro studies. We have generated an in vitro model for tau aggregation that uses hiPSC - derived neurons expressing an aggregation prone, fluorescently tagged version of the human tau protein after lentiviral transduction. Upon addition of tau seeds in the form of recombinant sonicated paired helical filaments (sPHFs), the neurons show robust, disease-like aggregation of the tau protein. The model was developed as a plate-based high content screening assay coupled with an image analysis algorithm to evaluate the impact of small molecules or genetic perturbations on tau. We show that the assay can be used to evaluate small molecules or screen targeted compound libraries. Using siRNA-based gene knockdown, genes of interest can be evaluated, and we could show that a targeted gene library can be screened, by screening nearly 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in that assay. The assay uses an imaging-based readout, a relatively short timeline, quantifies the extent of tau aggregation, and also allows the assessment of cell viability. Furthermore, it can be easily adapted to different hiPSC lines or neuronal subtypes. Taken together, this complex and highly relevant approach can be routinely applied on a weekly basis in the screening funnels of several projects and generates data with a turnaround time of approximately five weeks.",

We identified a unique suicide inhibitor of mitochondrial proline dehydrogenase (Prodh), N-propargylglycine (N-PPG), which has anticancer and brain-enhancing mitohormesis properties, and we hypothesize that induction of mitohormesis by N-PPG protects against neurodegenerative diseases. We carried out a series of mouse studies designed to: i) compare brain and metabolic responses while on oral N-PPG treatment (50\u00a0mg/kg, 9-14\u00a0days) of B6CBA wildtype (WT) and short-lived transgenic R6/2 (HD) mice; and ii) evaluate potential brain and systemwide stress rebound responses in WT mice 2\u00a0months after cessation of extended mitohormesis induction by well-tolerated higher doses of N-PPG (100-200\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0x\u00a060\u00a0days). WT and HD mice showed comparable global evidence of N-PPG induced brain mitohormesis characterized by Prodh protein decay and increased mitochondrial expression of chaperone and Yme1l1 protease proteins. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis (RNAseq) showed partial normalization of HD whole brain transcriptomes toward those of WT mice. Comprehensive metabolomic profiles performed on control and N-PPG treated blood, brain, and kidney samples revealed expected N-PPG-induced tissue increases in proline levels in both WT and HD mice, accompanied by surprising parallel increases in hydroxyproline and sarcosine. Two months after cessation of the higher dose N-PPG stress treatments, WT mouse brains showed robust rebound increases in Prodh protein levels and mitochondrial transcriptome responses, as well as altered profiles of blood amino acid-related metabolites. Our HD and WT mouse preclinical findings point to the brain penetrating and mitohormesis-inducing potential of the drug candidate, N-PPG, and provide new rationale and application insights supporting its further preclinical testing in various models of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of mitochondrial proteostasis.",

The accumulated amounts of A\u03b2, \u0394fmax, was determined from the measurement of the maximal frequency reduction using QCM. The plots of \u0394fmax to A\u03b2 concentration gave the slope and saturated value of \u0394fmax, (\u0394fmax)sat that are the parameters for binding property of A\u03b2 to lipid membranes.

The LP violation observed in both parameters resulted from the formation of the crevice or pothole, as A\u03b2-specific binding site, generated at the boundary between ld and lo phases. The LP violation observed only in the slope resulted from glycolipid-rich domain acting as A\u03b2-specific binding site. Furthermore, lipid planar membranes indicating strong LP violation favored strong fibrillogenesis. Especially, lipid planar membranes indicating the LP violation only in the slope induced lateral aggregated and spherulitic fibrillar aggregates.

        "AbstractText": "Neurological disorders (NDs) have become a major cause of both cognitive and physical disabilities worldwide. In NDs, misfolded proteins tend to adopt a \u03b2-sheet-rich fibrillar structure called amyloid. Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plays a crucial role in the nervous system. The misfolding and aggregation of A\u03b2 are primary factors in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the oligomerization and aggregation of A\u03b2 is considered as an effective strategy against NDs. While it is known that berberine analogs exhibit anti-A\u03b2 aggregation properties, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we have employed computational approaches to unravel the possible mechanism by which berberine combats A\u03b2 aggregation. The introduction of berberine was observed to delay the equilibrium of A\u03b216-21 oligomerization. Initially, within the first 10\u00a0ns of simulation, \u03b2-sheets content was 12.89\u00a0% and gradually increased to 22.19\u00a0% within the first 20\u00a0ns. This upward trend continued, reaching 32.80\u00a0%. However, berberine substantially reduced the formation of \u03b2-sheets to 1.36\u00a0%. These findings decipher the potency of berberine against A\u03b216-21 oligomerization, a crucial step for \u03b2-sheet formation. Additionally, a remarkable decrease in total number of hydrogen bonds was found in the presence of berberine. Berberine also led to a slight reduction in the flexibility of A\u03b216-21, which may be due to the formation of a more stable structures. This study offers valuable insights at the mechanistic level, which could prove beneficial in the development of new drugs to combat NDs.",

Moreover, dysregulation of the CYFIP protein family is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relevance of the CYFIP family in other dementias is largely unknown. Here, we compared CYFIP1/2 protein levels in the post-mortem hippocampus from patients with AD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Consistent with previous findings, CYFIP2 was reduced in AD hippocampus. In DLB and VaD hippocampus, the protein level of CYFIP2 and CYFIP1 was unaltered. Finally, an increase in the protein level of both CYFIP1 and CYFIP2 was noted in FTLD-TDP hippocampus. These findings reveal that the protein levels of the CYFIP family is distinct in different types of dementia, suggesting that the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders has divergent impacts on hippocampal synaptic function.",

The objective of this study was to assess the quantitative impact of neurodegenerative diseases in rural areas of the Spanish-Portuguese border region and to describe the epidemiological profile of the most prevalent disorders in one of the most depopulated and aged regions of Europe. A cross-sectional descriptive study was designed to estimate the prevalence of subjects diagnosed with the most common neurodegenerative disorders: dementia (Alzheimer's disease and other dementias), Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism, and multiple sclerosis in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border border region in 2020. It includes Bragan\u00e7a and Guarda Districts (Portugal) and Salamanca (Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Spain). Neurodegenerative diseases accounted for 1.85% in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region in 2020; a total of 5,819 records were reported: 987 (prevalence, 2.51%) in Salamanca (Spain); 2,332 (prevalence, 1.87%) in Bragan\u00e7a; and 2,500 (prevalence, 1.66%) in Guarda. Female population suffered from them in higher proportion (2.35 vs. 1.32%). Dementia represented 1.19% (3,744), Parkinson's disease and Parkinsonism 0.58% (1,823), and multiple sclerosis 0.08% (252). These disorders impacted older age groups. In the rural border region of Spain, 1 out of 4 cases were institutionalized. The findings reveal the health impact of neurodegenerative diseases in the Spanish-Portuguese cross-border region. The epidemiological data emphasize the region's circumstances and highlight research priorities.

Consequently, the disproportionately high risk and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) among rural and minoritized older residents will likely increase. To address this threat, we tested the hypotheses that (1) a faith-based, resident-led approach would increase basic ADRD knowledge and diagnosis, and (2) older age, female gender, lower educational levels, and more years lived rural would predict number of referrals, new dementia diagnoses, and treatment. An adaptation of Schoenberg's Faith Moves Mountains model, previously successful in detection and management of other chronic illnesses in rural settings, guided this community-based participatory research. Local faith community members were trained as research assistants to recruit, administer surveys, conduct brief memory assessments, teach brain health strategies, and follow-up with residents.

In the last few years, there has been a significant upsurge in the level of interest towards the function of molecular chaperones in the control of misfolding and aggregation. The crucial molecular chaperones implicated in neurodegenerative illnesses are covered in this review article, along with a variety of their different methods of action. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones serve critical roles in preserving protein homeostasis. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones have integral roles in preserving regulation of protein balance. It has been demonstrated that aging, a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, affects how molecular chaperones function. The aggregation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration may be facilitated by the aging-related reduction in chaperone activity. Molecular chaperones have also been linked to the pathophysiology of several instances of neuron withering illnesses, enumerating as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones have become potential therapy targets concerning with the prevention and therapeutic approach for brain disorders due to their crucial function in protein homeostasis and their connection to neurodegenerative illnesses. Protein homeostasis can be restored, and illness progression can be slowed down by methods that increase chaperone function or modify their expression.

Using the gold-modified nanopipette sensor with a copper chelating ligand, we evaluated the accumulation ability of the liposomal form of an anticancer Cu-containing complex at three levels of biological organization. First, we detected Cu2+ ions in a single cell model of human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 and in murine melanoma B16 cells. The insertion of the nanoelectrode did not result in leakage of the cell membrane. We then evaluated the distribution of the Cu-complex in MCF-7 tumor spheroids and found that the diffusion-limited accumulation was a function of the depth, typical for 3D culture. Finally, we demonstrated the use of the sensor for Cu2+ ion detection in the brain of an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and tumor-bearing mice in response to injection (2 mg kg-1) of the liposomal form of the anticancer Cu-containing complex. Enhanced stability and selectivity, as well as distinct copper oxidation peaks, confirmed that the developed sensor is a promising tool for testing various types of biological systems. In summary, this research has demonstrated a minimally invasive electrochemical technique with high temporal resolution that can be used for the study of metabolism of copper or copper-based drugs in vitro and in vivo.",

Here we investigate how the water modality affects conformational changes, solubility, and motion of fibrillar proteins. The hypothesis is that the introduction of a poly hydroxyl amino acid would increase solvation of the fibril forming peptides, preventing their misfolding and aggregation. For the amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide, which is considered to be connected with nervous system diseases, including dementia and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of \u03b2-sheet fibrils always occurs with a conformational change and a decrease in the dynamic hydration shell around A\u03b2(1-42). We present novel cyclic d-amino acid peptides that effectively inhibit fibrillation through affecting the dynamic hydration shell of A\u03b2(1-42) in vitro. Using de novo design within the software Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), five different peptides that recognize Alzheimer's fibrils were designed and synthesized. Three of them were cyclic all-d-amino acid peptides incorporating the same polyhydroxy building block derived from d-glucosaminic acid (GA). One peptide was the parent cyclic all d-amino acid inhibitor with no GA incorporated, and another was an all l-amino acid linear fibrillation inhibitor. The GA-containing peptides were found to show significantly improved inhibition of A\u03b2(1-42) aggregation. The inhibition was dramatically improved by the synergistic application of two GA peptides targeting each end of the growing fibril.

Subsequently my team discovered that this PHF protein and the microtubule-associated factor called tau were one and the same protein. However, we found that tau in neurofibrillary tangles/PHFs in AD brain was abnormally hyperphosphorylated, and unlike normal tau, which promoted the assembly of tubulin into microtubules, the AD-hyperphosphorylated tau inhibited microtubule assembly. These discoveries of tau pathology in AD opened a new and a major area of research on tau and on the molecular pathology of this major cause of dementia in middle- and old-age individuals. Tau pathology, which without fail is made up of the aggregated hyperphosphorylated state of the protein, is also the hallmark lesion of a family of around 20 related neurodegenerative diseases, called tauopathies. Currently, tau pathology is a major drug target for the treatment of AD and related tauopathies. Both active and passive tau immunization human clinical trials at various stages are underway.

Early and accurate detection of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) (1-42) monomers, a key biomarker of AD pathology, is crucial for effective diagnosis and intervention of the disease. Current gold standard detection techniques for A\u03b2 include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance. Although reliable, they are limited by their cost and time-consuming nature, thus restricting their point-of-care applicability. Here we present a sensitive and rapid colorimetric sensor for the detection of A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers within 5 min. This was achieved by harnessing the peroxidase-like activity of metal-loaded metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically UiO-66-NH2, coupled with the strong affinity of A\u03b2 (1-42) to the MOFs. Various metal-loaded MOFs were synthesized and investigated, and platinum-loaded UiO-66-NH2 was identified as the optimal candidate for our purpose. The Pt-loaded UiO-66-NH2 sensor demonstrated detection limits of 2.76 and 4.65 nM A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers in water and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively, with a linear range from 0.75 to 25 nM (R2 = 0.9712), outperforming traditional detection techniques in terms of both detection time and complexity. Moreover, the assay was specific toward A\u03b2 (1-42) monomers when evaluated against interfering compounds.

Its versatile nature allows it to participate in a multitude of pathological and physiological processes within the organism. One of its crucial functions is acting as a microRNA sponge, modulating protein transcription levels, and forming interactions with essential RNA-binding proteins. Remarkably, circRNAs demonstrates a specific enrichment in various vital areas of the brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, white matter, and photoreceptor neurons, particularly in aging organisms. This intriguing characteristic has led scientists to explore its potential as a significant biological marker of neurodegeneration, offering promising insights into neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, there has been an interesting observation of elevated levels of circRNAs in both peripheral blood and synaptic terminals of affected individuals. This intriguing finding raises the possibility that circRNAs may have a central role in the initiation and progression of AD. Notably, different categories of circRNAs, including HDAC9, HOMER1, Cwc27, Tulp4, and PTK2, have been implicated in driving the pathological changes associated with AD through diverse mechanisms. For instance, these circRNAs have been demonstrated to contribute to the accumulation of beta-amyloid, which is a hallmark characteristic of AD. Additionally, these circRNAs contribute to the excessive phosphorylation of tau protein, a phenomenon associated with neurofibrillary tangles, further exacerbating the disease. Moreover, they are involved in aggravating neuroinflammation, which is known to play a critical role in AD's pathogenesis. Lastly, these circRNAs can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupting cellular energy production and leading to cognitive impairment.

But the relationship between the two is still controversial. This study used seed-based d mapping software to conduct a meta-analysis of the whole brain resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study, exploring the differences in amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) between patients (AD or T2DM) and healthy controls (HCs), and searching for neuroimaging evidence that can explain the relationship between the two diseases. The final study included 22 datasets of ALFF and 22 datasets of CBF. The results of T2DM group showed that ALFF increased in both cerebellum and left inferior temporal gyrus regions, but decreased in left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior occipital gyrus, and left anterior central gyrus regions. In the T2DM group, CBF increased in the right supplementary motor area, while decreased in the middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus. The results of the AD group showed that the ALFF increased in the right cerebellum, right hippocampus, and right striatum, while decreased in the precuneus gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus. In the AD group, CBF in the anterior precuneus gyrus and inferior parietal gyrus decreased. Multimodal analysis within a disease showed that ALFF and CBF both decreased in the occipital lobe of the T2DM group and in the precuneus and parietal lobe of the AD group. In addition, there was a common decrease of CBF in the right middle occipital gyrus in both groups. Based on neuroimaging evidence, we believe that T2DM and AD are two diseases with their respective characteristics of central nervous activity and cerebral perfusion.

Tau accumulates in Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), progressive supranuclear palsy, and related tauopathies. Knowledge of the mechanisms for tau propagation in neurodegeneration is necessary for understanding the development of dementia. Exosomes, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), have emerged as participants in promoting tau propagation. Recent findings show that EVs generated by neurons expressing familial mutations of tauopathies of FTDP-17 (P301L and V337M) (mTau) and presenilin (A246E) (mPS1) in AD induce tau propagation and accumulation after injection into rodent brain. To gain knowledge of the proteome cargoes of the mTau and mPS1 EVs that promote tau pathogenesis, this review compares the proteomes of these EVs, which results in important new questions concerning EV mechanisms of tau pathogenesis. Proteomics data show that EVs produced by mTau- and mPS1-expressing iPSC neurons share proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicle secretion and, notably, these EVs also possess differences in protein components of vesicle-mediated transport, extracellular functions, and cell adhesion. It will be important for future studies to gain an understanding of the breadth of familial genetic mutations of tau, presenilin, and other genes in promoting EV initiation of tau propagation and pathogenesis.

Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which is regulated transcriptionally by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), is able to proteolyze A\u03b2.

Ginsenoside Rg1 is one of the active ingredients in the natural medicine ginseng and has inhibitory effects on A\u03b2 production. The present study was designed to investigate whether ginsenoside Rg1 is able to affect the regulation of PPAR\u03b3 based on the expression of its target gene, IDE, and whether it is able to promote A\u03b2 degradation via inhibition of the ERK/PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation pathway.

ELISA was subsequently employed to detect the intra- and extracellular A\u03b21-42 levels, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used to detect the translocation of ERK from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, immunofluorescence double staining was used to detect the co-expression of ERK and PPAR\u03b3, and finally, western blotting was used to detect the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112 and IDE expression.

Furthermore, administration of ginsenoside Rg1 or PD98059 resulted in attenuated co-expression of ERK and PPAR\u03b3, inhibition of phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112 mediated by ERK and an increase in IDE expression. In addition, the effects when PD98059 to inhibit ERK followed by treatment with ginsenoside Rg1 were found to be more pronounced than those when using PD98059 alone. In conclusion, ginsenoside Rg1 was demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects on AD via inhibition of the ERK/PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation pathway, which led to an increase in IDE expression, the promotion of A\u03b2 degradation and the decrease of neuronal apoptosis. These results could provide a theoretical basis for the clinical application of ginsenoside Rg1 in AD.",

        "AbstractText": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Icariside II (ICS II) is known to confer notable therapeutic effects against a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of ICS II on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced SK-N-SH cell injury, in addition to understanding the underlying mechanism of action. The MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cell model was used to simulate PD in vitro. The viability and mitochondrial membrane potential of SK-N-SH cells were detected by MTT assay and JC-1 staining, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, ATP levels and complex I activity in treated SK-N-SH cells were measured using LDH activity, ATP and Complex I assay kits, respectively. The protein expression levels of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and \u03b3-H2A histone family member X and the copy number of mitochondrial DNA were measured by western blotting or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, respectively. Autodock 4.2 was used to predict the molecular docking site of ICS II on HDAC2. The results of the present study demonstrated that ICS II mitigated SK-N-SH cytotoxicity induced by MPP+. Specifically, ICS II alleviated DNA damage and restored mitochondrial function in SK-N-SH cells treated with MPP+. In addition, ICS II reduced the HDAC2 protein expression levels in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells. However, overexpression of HDAC2 reversed the protective effects of ICS II on DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in MPP+-induced SK-N-SH cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that ICS II can protect dopaminergic neurons from MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by downregulating HDAC2 expression to restore mitochondrial function.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Mobile circular DNAs regulating memory and communication in CNS neurons.",
        "AbstractText": "Stimuli that stimulate neurons elicit transcription of immediate-early genes, a process which requires local sites of chromosomal DNA to form double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by topoisomerase IIb within a few minutes, followed by repair within a few hours. Wakefulness, exploring a novel environment, and contextual fear conditioning also elicit turn-on of synaptic genes requiring DSBs and repair. It has been reported (in non-neuronal cells) that extrachromosomal circular DNA can form at DSBs as the sites are repaired. I propose that activated neurons may generate extrachromosomal circular DNAs during repair at DSB sites, thus creating long-lasting \"markers\" of that activity pattern which contain sequences from their sites of origin and which regulate long-term gene expression. Although the population of extrachromosomal DNAs is diverse and overall associated with pathology, a subclass of small circular DNAs (\"microDNAs,\" \u223c100-400 bases long), largely derives from unique genomic sequences and has attractive features to act as stable, mobile circular DNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Circular DNAs can be templates for the transcription of RNAs, particularly small inhibitory siRNAs, circular RNAs and other non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNAs. These may regulate translation and transcription of other genes involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Another possible fate for mobile DNAs is to be inserted stably into chromosomes after new DSB sites are generated in response to subsequent activation events. Thus, the insertions of mobile DNAs into activity-induced genes may tend to inactivate them and aid in homeostatic regulation to avoid over-excitation, as well as providing a \"counter\" for a neuron's activation history. Moreover, activated neurons release secretory exosomes that can be transferred to recipient cells to regulate their gene expression. Mobile DNAs may be packaged into exosomes, released in an activity-dependent manner, and transferred to recipient cells, where they may be templates for regulatory RNAs and possibly incorporated into chromosomes. Finally, aging and neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease) are also associated with an increase in DSBs in neurons. It will become important in the future to assess how pathology-associated DSBs may relate to activity-induced mobile DNAs, and whether the latter may potentially contribute to pathogenesis.",

A relevant part of the way of speaking is what is known as prosody, or the variations a speaker makes when talking. To our knowledge, no research has analyzed the relevance of communication for caregivers when speaking with AD patients or what they consider the most effective strategies to communicate with them. Therefore, this pilot study aims are twofold: to know the relevance caregivers (professionals and family) give to communication with AD patients; and to determine what prosody strategies they consider most effective. Two hundred fifty-two caregivers of AD patients (professional and family) participated in two online surveys, answering different questions about the relevance of communication and the best prosody strategies. They also performed an auditory perceptual assessment. The results showed that caregivers give communication a significant role in the patient's treatment behavior. They consider Alzheimer's (AD) patients should be spoken to with authority but with affection and positiveness. The most valued prosodic strategies were marked intonation, speaking affectionately, emphasizing essential words, a medium/low pitch, and a slow speed.

These include alterations in cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and tissue biomechanics. Noninvasive quantitative assessment of neurofluid flow and tissue motion is feasible with phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC MRI). While two-dimensional (2D) PC MRI is routinely utilized in research and clinical settings to assess flow dynamics through a single imaging slice, comprehensive neurofluid dynamic assessment can be limited or impractical. Recently, four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI (or time-resolved three-dimensional PC with three-directional velocity encoding) has emerged as a powerful extension of 2D PC, allowing for large volumetric coverage of fluid velocities at high spatiotemporal resolution within clinically reasonable scan times. Yet, most 4D flow studies have focused on blood flow imaging. Characterizing CSF flow dynamics with 4D flow (i.e., 4D CSF flow) is of high interest to understand normal brain and spine physiology, but also to study neurological disorders such as dysfunctional brain metabolite waste clearance, where CSF dynamics appear to play an important role. However, 4D CSF flow imaging is challenged by the long T1 time of CSF and slower velocities compared with blood flow, which can result in longer scan times from low flip angles and extended motion-sensitive gradients, hindering clinical adoption. In this work, we review the state of 4D CSF flow MRI including challenges, novel solutions from current research and ongoing needs, examples of clinical and research applications, and discuss an outlook on the future of 4D CSF flow.",

The effects of chronic glutamate hyperactivity on vesicular and protein transport within CNS neurons, that is, processes necessary for neurite growth, have not been examined previously. In this study, we measured the effects of lifelong hyperactivity of glutamate neurotransmission on axoplasmic transport in CNS neurons. We compared wild-type (wt) to transgenic (Tg) mice over-expressing the glutamate dehydrogenase gene Glud1 in CNS neurons and exhibiting increases in glutamate transmitter formation, release, and synaptic activation in brain throughout the lifespan. We found that Glud1 Tg as compared with wt mice exhibited increases in the rate of anterograde axoplasmic transport in neurons of the hippocampus measured in brain slices ex\u00a0vivo, and in olfactory neurons measured in vivo. We also showed that the in vitro pharmacologic activation of glutamate synapses in wt mice led to moderate increases in axoplasmic transport, while exposure to selective inhibitors of ion channel forming glutamate receptors very significantly suppressed anterograde transport, suggesting a link between synaptic glutamate receptor activation and axoplasmic transport. Finally, axoplasmic transport in olfactory neurons of Tg mice in vivo was partially inhibited following 14-day intake of ethanol, a known suppressor of axoplasmic transport and of glutamate neurotransmission. The same was true for transport in hippocampal neurons in slices from Glud1 Tg mice exposed to ethanol for 2\u2009h ex\u00a0vivo. In conclusion, endogenous activity at glutamate synapses regulates and glutamate synaptic hyperactivity increases intraneuronal transport rates in CNS neurons.",

        "AbstractText": "The aggregation of amyloid \u03b2(A\u03b2) peptides is at the heart of Alzheimer's disease development and progression. As a result, amyloid aggregates have been studied extensively in vitro, and detailed structural information on fibrillar amyloid aggregates is available. However, forwarding these structural models to amyloid plaques in the human brain is still a major challenge. The chemistry of amyloid plaques, particularly in terms of the protein secondary structure and associated chemical moieties, remains poorly understood. In this report, we use Raman microspectroscopy to identify the presence of carotenoids in amyloid plaques and demonstrate that the abundance of carotenoids is correlated with the overall protein secondary structure of plaques, specifically to the population of \u03b2-sheets. While the association of carotenoids with plaques has been previously identified, their correlation with the \u03b2 structure has never been identified. To further validate these findings, we have used optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy, which is a spatially resolved technique that yields complementary infrared contrast to Raman. O-PTIR unequivocally demonstrates the presence of elevated \u03b2-sheets in carotenoid-containing plaques and the lack of \u03b2 structure in noncarotenoid plaques. Our findings underscore the potential link between anti-inflammatory species as carotenoids to specific secondary structural motifs within A\u03b2 plaques and highlight the possible role of chemically distinct plaques in neuroinflammation, which can uncover new mechanistic insights and lead to new therapeutic strategies for AD.",

Here, we offer a detailed 10-step approach to frailty index creation, with a worked example. We identified 10 steps to guide the creation of a valid and reliable frailty index. We then used data from waves 5 to 12 of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to illustrate the steps. The 10 steps are as follows: (1) select every variable that measures a health problem; (2) exclude variables with more than 5% missing values; (3) recode the responses to 0 (no deficit) through 1 (deficit); (4) exclude variables when coded deficits are too rare (< 1%) or too common (> 80%); (5) screen the variables for association with age; (6) screen the variables for correlation with each other; (7) count the variables retained; (8) calculate the frailty index scores; (9) test the characteristics of the frailty index; (10) use the frailty index in analyses. In our worked example, we created a 61-item frailty index following these 10 steps. This 10-step procedure can be used as a template to create one continuous health variable.

The human EC continues to develop during childhood5, but neurogenesis and neuronal migration to the EC are widely considered to be complete by birth. Here we show that the human temporal lobe contains many young neurons migrating into the postnatal EC and adjacent regions, with a large tangential stream persisting until the age of around one year and radial dispersal continuing until around two to three years of age. By contrast, we found no equivalent postnatal migration in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ganglionic\u00a0eminence germinal zones, the EC stream and the postnatal EC revealed that most migrating cells in the EC stream are derived from the caudal ganglionic eminence and become LAMP5+RELN+ inhibitory interneurons. These late-arriving interneurons could continue to shape the processing of sensory and spatial information well into postnatal life, when children are actively interacting with their environment. The EC is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected in Alzheimer's disease, and previous work has linked cognitive decline to the loss of LAMP5+RELN+ cells6,7.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative neurologic condition that results in the deterioration of several brain processes (e.g. memory loss). The most notable physical alteration in AD is the impairment of brain cells. An accurate examination of brain pictures may help to find the disease earlier because early diagnosis is crucial to enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes. Therefore, an easy and error-free system for AD diagnosis has recently received much research attention. Conventional image processing techniques sometimes cannot observe the significant features. As a result, the objective of this research is to develop an accurate and efficient method for identifying AD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To begin with, the brain regions in the MRI images are segmented using a powerful Deep ResUnet-based approach. Then, the global and local features from the segmented images are recovered using a Multi-Scale Attention Siamese Network (MASNet)-based network. After extracting the features, the Slime Mould Algorithm-based feature selection process is conducted. Finally, the stages of AD are categorized using the EfficientNetB7 model. The efficacy of the presented method has been tested using brain MRI scans from the Kaggle dataset and the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and it achieves 99.31% and 99.38% accuracy, respectively. Finally, the study results show that the suggested method is helpful for accurate AD categorization.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

        "AbstractText": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR), leucine-rich-repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is one of the key players in neuroinflammation, which is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Activated NLRP3 causes release of pro-inflammatory molecules that aggravate neurodegeneration. Thus, pharmacologically inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome has the potential to alleviate the inflammatory injury to the neurons. Coumarin is a multifunctional nucleus with potent anti-inflammatory properties and can be utilized to develop novel drugs for the treatment and management of AD. In the present study, we have explored the NLRP3-inhibitory activities of a library of coumarin derivatives through a computational drug discovery approach. Drug-like, PAINS free, and potentially BBB permeable compounds were screened out and subjected to molecular docking and in silico ADMET studies, resulting in three virtual hits, i.e. MolPort-050-872-358, MolPort-050-884-068, and MolPort-051-135-630. The hits exhibited better NLRP3-binding affinity than MCC950, a selective inhibitor of NLRP3. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, post-MD simulation analyses, and binding free energy calculations of the hits established their potential as promising virtual leads with a common coumarin scaffold for the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The most discussed is the pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), where 17\u03b2-HSD10 overexpression and its interaction with amyloid-\u03b2 peptide contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal stress. In this work, a series of new benzothiazole-derived 17\u03b2-HSD10 inhibitors were designed based on the structure-activity relationship analysis of formerly published inhibitors. A set of enzyme-based and cell-based methods were used to evaluate the inhibitory potency of new compounds, their interaction with the enzyme, and their cytotoxicity. Most compounds exhibited significantly a higher inhibitory potential compared to published benzothiazolyl ureas and good target engagement in a cellular environment accompanied by low cytotoxicity. The best hits displayed mixed-type inhibition with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the nanomolar range for the purified enzyme (3-7, 15) and/or low micromolar IC50 values in the cell-based assay (6, 13-16).",

        "AbstractText": "With each passing year, the number of people suffering from mental disorders grows at a disturbing speed. Neuroactive steroids are a new promising group of drugs with the potential for use in many diseases like postpartum depression, postnatal psychosis, major depression, insomnia, bipolar disorder, and Parkinson's tremor, due to their ability to modulate the activity of GABAA receptor. Neurosteroids are progesterone metabolites that are synthesized from cholesterol or steroid hormones in various brain regions. They regulate neuronal development, regeneration, and neurotransmission. They are implicated in mood disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, PTSD, and impulsive aggression. Neurosteroids have been studied for their potential to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated dementia. They can promote neurogenesis, neuronal survival, myelination, and memory function. They can also affect the growth and sensitivity of hormone-dependent brain tumors such as gliomas. Zuranolone, a newly registered neurosteroid drug has shown huge flexibility in both clinical and ambulatory treatment thanks to its pharmacokinetic traits, especially the possibility for oral administration, unlike its predecessor Brexanolone. Zuranolone is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor that can be taken orally. The review aims to summarize the current knowledge on zuranolone as a novel neurosteroid drug for various mental disorders, especially for postpartum mental disorders for which this drug was meant originally. It covers studies indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases published since 2017. Keywords used in the search, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria, are given in the aims and methodology section. The review explains the evidence for the role of neurosteroids, especially allopregnanolone, in the pathophysiology and treatment of postpartum depression. It discusses the mechanisms of neurosteroid action, the changes in neurosteroid levels during pregnancy and postpartum, and the clinical trials of brexanolone and zuranolone, two synthetic analogs of allopregnanolone, for postpartum depression. It provides an overview of the biosynthesis and metabolism of neurosteroids in the central and peripheral nervous system. Furthermore, it explains the different sources and pathways of neurosteroid production and the factors that influence their synthesis and regulation, such as stress, hormones, drugs, and genetic variations. The review also explores the potential relevance of neurosteroids for other psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Finally, it highlights the associations between neurosteroid levels and symptom severity and the effects of neurosteroid modulation on mood, cognition, and neuroplasticity.",

        "AbstractText": "In disorders of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, neurodegeneration is the final common pathway of disease progression. Modulating, reversing, or preventing disease progression is a clinical imperative most likely to succeed following accurate and explanatory understanding of neurodegeneration, requiring enhanced consistency with quantitative measurements and expanded interpretability of complex data. The on-going study of neurodegeneration has robustly demonstrated the advantages of accumulating large amounts of clinical data that include neuroimaging, motiving multi-center studies such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Demonstrative advantages also arise from highly multivariate analysis methods, and this work reports advances provided by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF revealed patterns of covariance for glucose metabolism, estimated by positron emission tomography of [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose, in 243 healthy normal participants of ADNI. Patterns for glucose metabolism provided cross-sectional inferences for 860 total participants of ADNI with and without cerebral amyloidosis and clinical dementia ratings (CDR) ranging 0-3. Patterns for glucose metabolism were distinct in number and topography from patterns identified in previous studies of structural MRI. They were also distinct from well-establish topographies of resting-state neuronal networks mapped by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patterns for glucose metabolism identified significant topographical landmarks relating age, sex, APOE \u03b54 alleles, amyloidosis, CDR, and neurodegeneration. Patterns involving insular and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as midline regions of frontal and parietal lobes demonstrated the greatest neurodegeneration with progressive Alzheimer's dementia. A single pattern for the lateral parietal and posterior superior temporal cortices demonstrated preserved glucose metabolism for all diagnostic groups, including Alzheimer's dementia. Patterns correlated significantly with topical terms from the Neurosynth platform, thereby providing semantic representations for patterns such as attention, memory, language, fear/reward, movement and motor planning. In summary, NMF is a data-driven, principled, supervised statistical learning method that provides interpretable patterns of neurodegeneration. These patterns can help inform the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \u25aa Data-driven non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) identified 24 canonical patterns of spatial covariance of cerebral glucose metabolism. The training data comprised healthy older participants (CDR = 0 without amyloidosis) cross-sectionally drawn from ADNI. \u25aa In healthy participants, mean SUVRs for specific patterns in precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, and subcortical areas including superficial white matter and striatum, demonstrated increasing glucose metabolism with advancing age. \u25aa In asymptomatic participants with amyloidosis , glucose metabolism increased compared to those who were asymptomatic without amyloid , particularly in medial prefrontal cortex, frontoparietal cortex, occipital white, and posterior cerebellar regions. \u25aa In symptomatic participants with amyloidosis , insular cortex, medial frontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex demonstrated the most severe losses of glucose metabolism with increasing CDR.

In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of gamma stimulation in treating AD and delve into the possible mechanisms responsible for its positive effects. Recent studies reveal that it is feasible and safe to induce 40\u00a0Hz brain activity in AD patients through a range of 40\u00a0Hz multisensory and noninvasive electrical or magnetic stimulation methods. Although research into the clinical potential of these interventions is still in its nascent stages, these studies suggest that 40\u00a0Hz stimulation can yield beneficial effects on brain function, disease pathology, and cognitive function in individuals with AD. Specifically, we discuss studies involving 40\u00a0Hz light, auditory, and vibrotactile stimulation, as well as noninvasive techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation in AD are not yet fully elucidated, but preclinical studies have provided relevant insights. We discuss preclinical evidence related to both neuronal and nonneuronal mechanisms that may be involved, touching upon the relevance of interneurons, neuropeptides, and specific synaptic mechanisms in translating gamma stimulation into widespread neuronal activity within the brain. We also explore the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and the vasculature in mediating the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation on brain function.

Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model.

In the present study, our focus was the investigation of cSVD-related phenotypic changes in microglia in human disease and in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP) model of cSVD. Our examination of cortical microglia in human post-mortem cSVD cortical tissue revealed distinct morphological microglial features specific to cSVD. We identified enlarged somata, an increase in the territory occupied by thickened microglial processes, and an expansion in the number of vascular-associated microglia. In parallel, we characterized microglia in a rodent model of hypertensive cSVD along different durations of arterial hypertension, i.e., early chronic and late chronic hypertension. Microglial somata were already enlarged in early hypertension. In contrast, at late-stage chronic hypertension, they further exhibited elongated branches, thickened processes, and a reduced ramification index, mirroring the findings in human cSVD. An unbiased multidimensional flow cytometric analysis revealed phenotypic heterogeneity among microglia cells within the hippocampus and cortex. At early-stage hypertension, hippocampal microglia exhibited upregulated CD11b/c, P2Y12R, CD200R, and CD86 surface expression. Detailed analysis of cell subpopulations revealed a unique microglial subset expressing CD11b/c, CD163, and CD86 exclusively in early hypertension. Notably, even at early-stage hypertension, microglia displayed a higher association with cerebral blood vessels. We identified several profound clusters of microglia expressing distinct marker profiles at late chronic hypertensive states. In summary, our findings demonstrate a higher vulnerability of the hippocampus, stage-specific microglial signatures based on morphological features, and cell surface protein expression in response to chronic arterial hypertension.

This study aimed to assess the potential associations between pemphigus, pemphigoid and AD in a large, nationally representative US cohort. All data of hospitalized patients aged 60\u2009years or older were extracted from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016-2018. Patients with a history of head trauma, diagnosis of vascular dementia, history of cerebrovascular disease, or malformation of cerebral vessels were excluded. The study population was divided into those with and without pemphigus (cohort 1) and with and without pemphigoid (cohort 2). Pemphigus was independently associated with a 69% increased risk of AD. Adults \u226580\u2009years old with pemphigus were 72% more likely to develop AD than adults without pemphigus. Women with pemphigus were 78% more likely to develop AD than women without pemphigus. On the other hand, pemphigoid was independently associated with a 39% increased risk for AD and subjects \u226580\u2009years with pemphigoid were 40% more likely to have AD than those without pemphigoid. Females with pemphigoid were 63% more likely to have AD than those without pemphigoid. Moreover, Hispanic older adults with pemphigus were 3-times more likely to have AD than those without pemphigoid. Pemphigus and pemphigoid were both independently associated with AD in older adults, especially among females and octogenarians. Further studies addressing the etiology and mechanisms underlying these associations are highly warranted.",

        "AbstractText": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) have been associated with a risk of accelerated cognitive decline or conversion to dementia of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) type. Moreover, the NPS were also associated with higher AD biomarkers (brain tau and amyloid burden) even in non-demented patients. But the effect of the relationship between NPS and biomarkers on cognitive decline has not yet been studied. This work aims to assess the relationship between longitudinal cognitive changes and NPS, specifically depression and anxiety, in association with AD biomarkers in healthy middle-aged to older participants. The cohort consisted of 101 healthy participants aged 50-70\u00a0years, 66 of whom had neuropsychological assessments of memory, executive functions, and global cognition at a 2-year follow-up. At baseline, NPS were assessed using the Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories while brain tau and amyloid loads were measured using positron emission topography. For tau burden, THK5351 uptake is used as a proxy of tau and neuroinflammation. Participants, declining or remaining stable at follow-up, were categorized into groups for each cognitive domain. Group classification was investigated using binary logistic regressions based on combined AD biomarkers and the two NPS. The results showed that an association between anxiety and prefrontal amyloid burden significantly classified episodic memory decline, while the classification of global cognitive decline involved temporal and occipital amyloid burden but not NPS. Moreover, depression together with prefrontal and hippocampal tau burden were associated with a decline in memory. The classification of participants based on executive decline was related to depression and mainly prefrontal tau burden. These findings suggest that the combination of NPS and brain biomarkers of AD predicts the occurrence of cognitive decline in aging.",

        "AbstractText": "Tau, a microtubule-associated protein predominantly localized in neuronal axons, plays a crucial role in promoting microtubule assembly, stabilizing their structure, and participating in axonal transport. Perturbations in tau's structure and function are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies, the most common disorder of which is Alzheimer's disease (AD). In tauopathies, it has been found that tau has a variety of post-translational modification (PTM) abnormalities and/or tau is cleaved into a variety of fragments by some specific proteolytic enzymes; however, the precise contributions of these abnormal modifications and fragments to disease onset and progression remain incompletely understood. Herein, we provide an overview about the involvement of distinctive abnormal tau PTMs and different tau fragments in the pathogenesis of AD and other tauopathies and discuss the involvement of proteolytic enzymes such as caspases, calpains, and asparagine endopeptidase in mediating tau cleavage while also addressing the intercellular transmission role played by tau. We anticipate that further exploration into PTMs and fragmented forms of tau will yield valuable insights for diagnostic approaches and therapeutic interventions targeting AD and other related disorders.",

The phenomenal-behavior patterns may be deconstructed into basic dimensions, i.e., psychomotricity, affectivity, and thought, which might have distinct neural correlates. This work provides a data overview on the relationship of these phenomenal-behavioral dimensions with brain activity across physiological and pathological conditions (including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, addictive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia). Accordingly, we propose a three-dimensional model of neural activity and phenomenal-behavioral patterns. In this model, neural activity is organized into distinct units in accordance with connectivity patterns and related input/output processing, manifesting in the different phenomenal-behavioral dimensions. (1) An external neural\u00a0unit, which involves the sensorimotor circuit/brain's sensorimotor network and is connected with the external environment, processes external inputs/outputs, manifesting in the psychomotor dimension (processing of exteroception/somatomotor activity). External unit hyperactivity manifests in psychomotor excitation (hyperactivity/hyperkinesia/catatonia), while external unit hypoactivity manifests in psychomotor inhibition (retardation/hypokinesia/catatonia). (2) An internal neural\u00a0unit, which involves the interoceptive-autonomic circuit/brain's salience network and is connected with the internal/body environment, processes internal inputs/outputs, manifesting in the affective dimension (processing of interoception/autonomic activity). Internal unit hyperactivity manifests in affective excitation (anxiety/dysphoria-euphoria/panic), while internal unit hypoactivity manifests in affective inhibition (anhedonia/apathy/depersonalization). (3) An associative neural\u00a0unit, which involves the brain's associative areas/default-mode network and is connected with the external/internal units (but not with the environment), processes associative inputs/outputs, manifesting in the thought dimension (processing of ideas). Associative unit hyperactivity manifests in thought excitation (mind-wandering/repetitive thinking/psychosis), while associative unit hypoactivity manifests in thought inhibition (inattention/cognitive deficit/consciousness loss). Finally, these neural units interplay and dynamically combine into various neural states, resulting in the complex phenomenal experience and behavior across physiology and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "AbstractText": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",

The gut microbiome is shaped at birth, while numerous genetic, dietary, and environmental variables primarily influence the microbiome composition. The importance of gut microbiota on host health is becoming more widely acknowledged. Digestion, intestinal permeability, and immunological and metabolism responses can all be affected by changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. There is mounting evidence that the microbial population's complex traits are important biomarkers and indicators of patient outcomes in cancer and its therapies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that changed commensal gut microorganisms contribute to the development and spread of cancer through various routes. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal cancer, accumulating evidence points to a potentially far more intricate connection than a simple cause-and-effect relationship. SIMPLE SUMMARY: Due to their high frequency and fatality rate, gastrointestinal cancers are regarded as a severe public health issue with complex medical and economic burdens. The gut microbiota may directly or indirectly interact with existing therapies like immunotherapy and chemotherapy, affecting how well a treatment works. The gut microbiome influences the immune response's activity, function, and development. Generally, certain gut bacteria impact the antitumor actions during cancer by creating particular metabolites or triggering T-cell responses. Yet, certain bacterial species have been found to promote cellular proliferation and metastasis in cancer, and comprehending these interactions in the context of cancer may help identify possible treatment targets. Notwithstanding the improvements in the field, additional research is still required to comprehend the underlying processes, examine the effects on existing therapies, and pinpoint certain bacteria and immune cells that can cause this interaction.",

        "AbstractText": "Independence in activities of daily living (ADLs) is associated with quality of life (QoL) in individuals with dementia. However, the contribution of physical and cognitive functions to this relationship needs further examination. This study aims to examine the mediating effect of physical fitness and cognitive function in the relationship between independence in basic ADLs and QoL among older adults with dementia. This cross-sectional study included 107 older adults with dementia (74.8% women; age 78.21\u2009\u00b1\u20097.70\u00a0years). Independence in basic ADL and QoL were evaluated using the Barthel Index (BI) and QoL- Alzheimer's Disease Scale, respectively. The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination were applied to assess cognitive function. Physical fitness was evaluated using the 30-s chair stand, 2-min step and the Timed-Up and Go tests. A structural equation modelling (SEM) with bootstrapping estimation was conducted to determine the relationship between all variables. Independence in basic ADL positively affected QoL and this association was mediated by physical fitness (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.242, p\u2009=\u20090.011). No statistically significant results were observed when testing cognitive function as a mediator between BI and QoL (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.009, p\u2009=\u20090.345). Physical fitness (i.e., lower body strength, aerobic capacity, and mobility) plays a role in the relationship between basic ADL independence and QoL of older adults with dementia, reinforcing the need to improve and monitor these parameters throughout the disease progression. Future longitudinal studies should explore the temporal relationship between physical and cognitive function and its contribution to basic ADL independence and QoL.",

Our aim was to compare disease-specific mortality by estimated occupational exposure to vapors, gasses, dusts, and fumes (VGDF). The data source is the Helsinki part of the population-based FinEsS study on chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases including information on age, education level, main occupation, sex, and tobacco smoking combined with death registry information. We compared estimated VGDF exposure to mortality using adjusted competing-risks regression for disease-specific survival analysis for a 24-year follow-up. Compared to the no-exposure group, the high occupational VGDF exposure group had sub-hazard ratios (sHR) of 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.2) for all cardiovascular-related and sHR 2.1 (1.5-3.9) for just coronary artery-related mortality. It also had sHR 1.7 (1.0-2.8) for Alzheimer's or vascular dementia-related mortality and sHR 1.7(1.2-2.4) for all respiratory disease-related mortality. Long-term occupational exposure to VGDF increased the hazard of mortality- to cardiovascular-, respiratory-, and dementia-related causes. This emphasizes the need for minimizing occupational long-term respiratory exposure to dust, gasses, and fumes.",

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great potential for modulation of A\u03b2 self-assembly, which is nevertheless limited by the inefficient utilization of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, an erythrocyte membrane (EM)-modified core-shell upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP/Cur@EM) is designed and fabricated as a biomimetic nanobait to improve the PDT efficiency in AD. The UCNP with the outlayer of mesoporous silica is synthesized to load a high amount of the photosensitizer (curcumin), the unique optical feature of which can trigger curcumin to generate ROS upon near-infrared light (NIR) irradiation. Integration of EM enables the biomimetic nanobait to attract A\u03b2 peptides trapped in the phospholipid bilayer, restraining the growth of A\u03b2 monomers to form aggregates and improving the utilization rate of ROS to degrade the preformed A\u03b2 aggregates. In vivo studies demonstrate that UCNP/Cur@EM irradiated by NIR enables to decrease A\u03b2 deposits, ameliorates memory deficits, and rescues cognitive functions in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model. A biocompatible and controllable way is provided here to inhibit the amyloid protein-associated pathological process of AD.",

It is also widely used by researchers examining the distribution and accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases including NP-C and Sanfilippo syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA; MPS IIIA). Recently, it has been suggested to be useful in studying Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Given filipin's susceptibility to photobleaching, we sought to establish a quantitative biochemical method for free cholesterol measurement. Brain tissue from mice with MPS IIIA was stained with filipin. Total and free cholesterol in brain homogenates was measured using a commercially available kit and a quantitative LC-MS/MS assay was developed. Gangliosides GM1, GM2 and GM3 were also quantified using LC-MS/MS. As anticipated, the MPS IIIA mouse brain displayed large numbers of filipin-positive intra-cytoplasmic inclusions, presumptively endo-lysosomes. Challenging the prevailing dogma, however, we found no difference in the amount of free cholesterol in MPS IIIA mouse brain homogenates cf. control tissue, using either the fluorometric kit or LC-MS/MS assay. Filipin has previously been reported to bind to GM1 ganglioside, however, this lipid does not accumulate in MPS IIIA cells/tissues. Using a fluorometric assay, we demonstrate for the first time that filipin cross-reacts with both GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, explaining the filipin-reactive inclusions observed in MPS IIIA brain cells. Filipin is not specific for free cholesterol, and positive staining in any setting should be interpreted with caution.",

However, the role of 2'-FL and HMO in gut microbiota modulation in relation to AD remains insufficiently investigated. This study aimed to elucidate the preventive effect of the 2'-FL and HMO impact of AD and the relevant mechanism involved. Here, the behavioral results showed that 2'-FL and HMO intervention decreased the expression of Tau phosphorylation and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), inhibited neuroinflammation, and restored cognitive impairment in AD mice. The metagenomic analysis proved that 2'-FL and HMO intervention restored the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in AD. Notably, 2'-FL and HMO intervention significantly enhanced the relative abundance of Clostridium and Akkermansia. The metabolomics results showed that 2'-FL and HMO enhanced the oleoyl-l-carnitine metabolism as potential drivers. More importantly, the levels of oleoyl-l-carnitine were positively correlated with the abundances of Clostridium and Akkermansia. These results indicated that 2'-FL and HMO had therapeutic potential to prevent AD-induced cognitive impairment, which is of great significance for the treatment of AD.",

Further analysis showed that secondary stressors played a predominant role in the increase in mental health difficulties. The main secondary stressors were loneliness, negative emotionality associated with the perception of COVID-19 disease, lack of resilience, female gender and younger age. The surge in stress levels and depressive symptoms persisted across all three consecutive COVID-19 waves. This persistence is attributable to the effects of secondary stressors, and particularly to the status of mental health before the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the combined contributions of multidomain lifestyle patterns to cognitive aging are poorly understood, as most studies have examined individual lifestyle behaviors in isolation and without neuropathological characterization. This study examined data-driven patterns of lifestyle behaviors across multiple domains among older adults and tested their associations with disease-specific neuropathological burden and cognitive decline. Participants included 2059 older adults enrolled in the longitudinal Memory and Aging Project (MAP) at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center; none of whom had dementia at baseline (73% no cognitive impairment (NCI), 27% mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). All participants completed cognitive testing annually. Lifestyle factors were measured during at least one visit and included (1) actigraphy-measured physical activity, as well as self-reported (2) sleep quality, (3) life space, (4) cognitive activities, (5) social activities, and (6) social network. A subset of participants (n = 791) had autopsy data for which burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis/TDP-43 was measured. Latent profile analysis across all 2059 participants identified distinct subgroups (i.e., classes) of lifestyle patterns. Linear mixed-effects models examined relationships between lifestyle classes and global cognitive trajectories, with and without covarying for all neuropathologies. Classes were also compared on rates of incident MCI/dementia. Five classes were identified: Class 1Low Life Space (lowest lifestyle engagement), Class 2PA (high physical activity), Class 3Low Avg (low to average lifestyle engagement), Class 4Balanced (high average lifestyle engagement), and Class 5Social (large social network). Classes 4Balanced and 5Social had the lowest AD burden, and Class 2PA had the lowest CVD burden. Classes 2-5 had significantly less steep global cognitive decline compared to Class 1Low Life Space, with comparable effect sizes before and after covarying for neuropathological burden. Classes 4Balanced and 5Social exhibited the lowest rates of incident MCI/dementia. Lifestyle behavior patterns among older adults account for differential rates of cognitive decline and clinical progression. Those with at least average engagement across all lifestyle domains exhibit greater cognitive stability after adjustment for neuropathology, highlighting the importance of engagement in multiple healthy lifestyle behaviors for later life cognitive health.",

While Treg-mediated neuroprotective activities are now well-accepted, the lack of defined antigen specificity limits their therapeutic potential. This is notable for neurodegenerative diseases where cell access to injured brain regions is required for disease-specific therapeutic targeting and improved outcomes. To address this need, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) antigen specificity was conferred to Treg responses by engineering the T cell receptor (TCR) specific for A\u03b2 (TCRA\u03b2). The TCRAb were developed from disease-specific T cell effector (Teff) clones. The ability of Tregs expressing a transgenic TCRA\u03b2 (TCRA\u03b2 -Tregs) to reduce A\u03b2 burden, transform effector to regulatory cells, and reverse disease-associated neurotoxicity proved beneficial in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. TCRA\u03b2 -Tregs were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of endogenous TCR and consequent incorporation of the transgenic TCRAb identified from A\u03b2 reactive Teff monoclones. Antigen specificity was confirmed by MHC-A\u03b2-tetramer staining.

        "AbstractText": "\"Brain-predicted age\" estimates biological age from complex, nonlinear features in neuroimaging scans. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD), but is underexplored in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), in which AD progression is highly predictable with minimal confounding age-related co-pathology. We modeled BAG in 257 deeply-phenotyped ADAD mutation-carriers and 179 non-carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network using minimally-processed structural MRI scans. We then tested whether BAG differed as a function of mutation and cognitive status, or estimated years until symptom onset, and whether it was associated with established markers of amyloid (PiB PET, CSF amyloid-\u03b2-42/40), phosphorylated tau (CSF and plasma pTau-181), neurodegeneration (CSF and plasma neurofilament-light-chain [NfL]), and cognition (global neuropsychological composite and CDR-sum of boxes). We compared BAG to other MRI measures, and examined heterogeneity in BAG as a function of ADAD mutation variants, APOE\u00a0\u03b54 carrier status, sex, and education. Advanced brain aging was observed in mutation-carriers approximately 7 years before expected symptom onset, in line with other established structural indicators of atrophy. BAG was moderately associated with amyloid PET and strongly associated with pTau-181, NfL, and cognition in mutation-carriers. Mutation variants, sex, and years of education contributed to variability in BAG. We extend prior work using BAG from sporadic AD to ADAD, noting consistent results. BAG associates well with markers of pTau, neurodegeneration, and cognition, but to a lesser extent, amyloid, in ADAD. BAG may capture similar signal to established MRI measures. However, BAG offers unique benefits in simplicity of data processing and interpretation. Thus, results in this unique ADAD cohort with few age-related confounds suggest that brain aging attributable to AD neuropathology can be accurately quantified from minimally-processed MRI.",

        "AbstractText": "Autosomal dominant pathogenic mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause Parkinson's disease (PD). The most common mutation, G2019S-LRRK2, increases the kinase activity of LRRK2 causing hyper-phosphorylation of its substrates. One of these substrates, Rab10, is phosphorylated at a conserved Thr73 residue (pRab10), and is one of the most abundant LRRK2 Rab GTPases expressed in various tissues. The involvement of Rab10 in neurodegenerative disease, including both PD and Alzheimer's disease makes pinpointing the cellular and subcellular localization of Rab10 and pRab10 in the brain an important step in understanding its functional role, and how post-translational modifications could impact function. To establish the specificity of antibodies to the phosphorylated form of Rab10 (pRab10), Rab10 specific antisense oligonucleotides were intraventricularly injected into the brains of mice. Further, Rab10 knock out induced neurons, differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells were used to test the pRab10 antibody specificity. To amplify the weak immunofluorescence signal of pRab10, tyramide signal amplification was utilized. Rab10 and pRab10 were expressed in the cortex, striatum and the substantia nigra pars compacta. Immunofluorescence for pRab10 was increased in G2019S-LRRK2 knockin mice. Neurons, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes all showed Rab10 and pRab10 expression. While Rab10 colocalized with endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome and trans-Golgi network markers, pRab10 did not localize to these organelles. However, pRab10, did overlap with markers of the presynaptic terminal in both mouse and human cortex, including \u03b1-synuclein. Results from this study suggest Rab10 and pRab10 are expressed in all brain areas and cell types tested in this study, but pRab10 is enriched at the presynaptic terminal. As Rab10 is a LRRK2 kinase substrate, increased kinase activity of G2019S-LRRK2 in PD may affect Rab10 mediated membrane trafficking at the presynaptic terminal in neurons in disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Machine learning (ML) has increasingly been used to assist and expand current practices in neuropathology. However, generating large imaging datasets with quality labels is challenging in fields which demand high levels of expertise. Further complicating matters is the often seen disagreement between experts in neuropathology-related tasks, both at the case level and at a more granular level. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are a hallmark pathological feature of Alzheimer disease, and are associated with disease progression which warrants further investigation and granular quantification at a scale not currently accessible in routine human assessment. In this work, we first provide a baseline of annotator/rater agreement for the tasks of Braak NFT staging between experts and NFT detection using both experts and novices in neuropathology. We use a whole-slide-image (WSI) cohort of neuropathology cases from Emory University Hospital immunohistochemically stained for Tau. We develop a workflow for gathering annotations of the early stage formation of NFTs (Pre-NFTs) and mature intracellular (iNFTs) and show\u00a0ML models can be trained to learn annotator nuances for the task of NFT detection in WSIs. We utilize a model-assisted-labeling approach and demonstrate ML models can be used to aid in labeling large datasets efficiently. We also show these models can be used to extract case-level features, which predict Braak NFT stages comparable to expert human raters, and do so at scale. This study provides a generalizable workflow for various pathology and related fields, and also provides a technique for accomplishing a high-level neuropathology task with limited human annotations.",

        "AbstractText": "In recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) as a complementary intervention in treating cognitive impairment has significantly increased. VR applications based on instrumental activities of daily living (iADL-VR) could offer a promising approach with greater ecological validity for intervention in groups with cognitive impairments. However, the effectiveness of this approach is still debated. This systematic review aims to synthesize the effects of iADL-VR interventions to rehabilitate, train, or stimulate cognitive functions in healthy adults and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and different types of dementia. A systematic search was performed in the Scopus, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and APA PsycNet databases until September 2022 and repeated in April 2023. The selected studies met the search terms, were peer-reviewed, included an iADL-VR intervention, and were written in English. Descriptive, qualitative studies, reviews, cognitive assessment, non-intervention studies, those unrelated to VR or iADL, those focused on motor aspects, and non-degenerative disorders were excluded. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the controlled studies. To present and synthesize the results, we organized the extracted data into three tables, including PEDro scores, participant characteristics, and study characteristics. Nineteen studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The total sample reached 590 participants, mostly women (72.67%). Approximately 30% were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, and 20% had mild cognitive impairment. Variables such as authors and year of publication, study design, type of intervention and VR applied, duration of the intervention, main findings, and conclusions were extracted. Regarding demographic characteristics, the sample size, age, sex, years of education, neurological diagnosis, dropouts, and the city and country where the intervention took place were recorded. Almost all studies showed improvements in some or all the outcomes after the intervention, generally greater in the iADL-VR group than in the control group. iADL-VR interventions could be beneficial in improving the performance of cognitive functions in older adults and people with MCI and different types of dementia. The ecological component of these tasks makes them very suitable for transferring what has been learned to the real world. However, such transfer needs to be confirmed by further studies with larger and more homogeneous samples and longer follow-up periods.

        "AbstractText": "Inflammasomes in astrocytes have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cannabinoid Receptor 2(CB2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is considered a promising therapeutic target in inflammation-related disorders. This study aims to explore the role of CB2R in regulating NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated neuroinflammation in astrocytes. In an in vivo animal model, specific targeting of astrocytic CB2R was achieved by injecting CB2R-specific adenovirus (or fork head box g1(foxg1) adenovirus) to knock down CB2R or administering CB2R agonists, inhibitors, etc., in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of mice. A PD mouse model was established using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induction. Animal behavioral tests, western blot, immunofluorescence, and other experiments were performed to assess the loss of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons, activation of astrocytes, and activation of the NLRP3 pathway. Primary astrocytes were cultured in vitro, and NLRP3 inflammasomes were activated using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Western blot and ELISA experiments were conducted to assess the release of inflammatory factors. Transcriptomic sequencing and CUT&RUN techniques were employed to study the CB2R regulation of the foxg1 binding site on the autophagy molecule microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B). Astrocytic CB2R knockdown impaired the motor abilities of MPTP-induced mice, exacerbated the loss of TH neurons, and induced activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/interleukin 1 (IL-1\u03b2) pathway. Activation of CB2R significantly alleviated motor impairments in mice while reducing NLRP3 deposition on astrocytes. In vitro cell experiments showed that CB2R activation attenuated the activation of the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1\u03b2 pathway induced by LPS\u2009+\u2009ATP or MPP+. Additionally, it inhibited the binding of foxg1 to MAP1LC3B, increased astrocytic autophagy levels, and facilitated NLRP3 degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Activation of CB2R on astrocytes effectively mitigates NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation and ameliorates the disease characteristics of PD in mice.

        "AbstractText": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with clinical presentations of progressive cognitive and memory deterioration. The pathologic hallmarks of AD include tau neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaque depositions in the hippocampus and associated neocortex. The neuronal aggregated tau observed in AD cells suggests that the protein folding problem is a major cause of AD. J-domain-containing proteins (JDPs) are the largest family of cochaperones, which play a vital role in specifying and directing HSP70 chaperone functions. JDPs bind substrates and deliver them to HSP70. The association of JDP and HSP70 opens the substrate-binding domain of HSP70 to help the loading of the clients. However, in the initial HSP70 cycle, which JDP delivers tau to the HSP70 system in neuronal cells remains unclear. We screened the requirement of a diverse panel of JDPs for preventing tau aggregation in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y by a filter retardation method. Interestingly, knockdown of DNAJB6, one of the JDPs, displayed tau aggregation and overexpression of DNAJB6b, one of the isoforms generated from the DNAJB6 gene by alternative splicing, reduced tau aggregation. Further, the tau bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay confirmed the DNAJB6b-dependent tau clearance. The co-immunoprecipitation and the proximity ligation assay demonstrated the protein-protein interaction between tau and the chaperone-cochaperone complex. The J-domain of DNAJB6b was critical for preventing tau aggregation. Moreover, reduced DNAJB6 expression and increased tau aggregation were detected in an age-dependent manner in immunohistochemical analysis of the hippocampus tissues of a mouse model of tau pathology. In summary, downregulation of DNAJB6b increases the insoluble form of tau, while overexpression of DNAJB6b reduces tau aggregation. Moreover, DNAJB6b associates with tau. Therefore, this study reveals that DNAJB6b is a direct sensor for its client tau in the HSP70 folding system in neuronal cells, thus helping to prevent AD.",

Our earlier published data indicated that the mice performed better than controls on the Morris Maze Test parallel with decreased occurrence of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques in the hippocampus. We investigated the neuroprotective and therapeutic effects of high-intensity training and postbiotic supplementation. Thirty-two adult APP/PS1TG mice were randomly divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) high-intensity training (3) postbiotic, (4) combined (training and postbiotic) treatment for 20 weeks. In this study, the whole hemibrain without hippocampus was used to find molecular traits explaining improved brain function. We applied qualitative RT-PCR for gene expression, Western blot for protein level, and Zymography for LONP1 activity. Disaggregation analysis of A\u03b2-40 was performed in the presence of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum lysate. We found that exercise training decreased Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related gene expression (NF-kB) that was not affected by postbiotic treatment. The preparation used for postbiotic treatment is composed of tyndallized Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Both of the postbiotics effectively disaggregated amyloid-\u03b2/A\u03b2-40 aggregates by chelating Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions. The postbiotic treatment decreased endogenous human APPTG protein expression and mouse APP gene expression in the hemibrains. In addition, the postbiotic treatment elevated mitochondrial LONP1 activity as well. Our findings revealed distinct mechanisms behind improved memory performance in the whole brain: while exercise training modulates NF-kB signaling pathway regulating immune response until postbiotic diminishes APP gene expression, disaggregates pre-existing amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and activates mitochondrial protein quality control in the region of brain out of hippocampus.

This study aims to determine the differences in aperiodic activity between AD and FTD and evaluate its potential for distinguishing between the two disorders. A total of 88 participants, including 36 patients with AD, 23 patients with FTD, and 29 healthy controls (CN) underwent cognitive assessment and scalp EEG acquisition. Neuronal power spectra were parameterized to decompose the EEG spectrum, enabling comparison of group differences in different components. A support vector machine was employed to assess the impact of aperiodic parameters on the differential diagnosis. Compared with the CN group, both the AD and FTD groups showed varying degrees of increased alpha power (both periodic and raw power) and theta alpha power ratio. At the channel level, theta power (both periodic and raw power) in the frontal regions was higher in the AD group compared to the FTD group, and aperiodic parameters (both exponents and offsets) in the frontal, temporal, central, and parietal regions were higher in the AD group than in the FTD group. Importantly, the inclusion of aperiodic parameters led to improved performance in distinguishing between the two disorders.

However, conventional methods often rely on single-modality data and supervised models, which provide only a limited perspective of the intricacies of the highly complex brain. Moreover, the scarcity of accurate diagnostic labels in clinical settings hinders the applicability of the supervised models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for extracting multiple representations from multimodal neuroimaging data to enhance group inferences and enable analysis without resorting to labeled data during pre-training. Our approach leverages Deep InfoMax (DIM), a self-supervised methodology renowned for its efficacy in learning representations by estimating mutual information without the need for explicit labels. While DIM has shown promise in predicting brain disorders from single-modality MRI data, its potential for multimodal data remains untapped. This work extends DIM to multimodal neuroimaging data, allowing us to identify disorder-relevant brain regions and explore multimodal links. We present compelling evidence of the efficacy of our multimodal DIM analysis in uncovering disorder-relevant brain regions, including the hippocampus, caudate, insula, - and multimodal links with the thalamus, precuneus, and subthalamus hypothalamus. Our self-supervised representations demonstrate promising capabilities in predicting the presence of brain disorders across a spectrum of Alzheimer's phenotypes. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art unsupervised methods based on autoencoders, canonical correlation analysis, and supervised models highlight the superiority of our proposed method in achieving improved classification performance, capturing joint information, and interpretability capabilities. The computational efficiency of the decoder-free strategy enhances its practical utility, as it saves compute resources without compromising performance.

Upregulated SP1 acted on two recognition motifs in the BACE1 gene to induce its transcription, resulting in enhanced A\u03b2 production. Mouse brain microdialysis revealed that nAChR agonists increased A\u03b2 levels in the interstitial fluid of the cerebral cortex but caused no delay of A\u03b2 clearance. In vitro assays indicated that nicotine inhibited A\u03b2 aggregation. We also found that nicotine modified the immunoreactivity of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies, possibly through competitive inhibition and A\u03b2 conformation changes.

Significant cerebellar gray matter changes appeared in the early stages of most subtypes and the very early stages of AD, LBD-AD, FTLD-TDP type A, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Cortical atrophy positively predicted cerebellar atrophy across all subtypes. Our findings establish pathology-specific profiles of cerebellar atrophy in ADRD and propose cerebellar neuroimaging as a non-invasive biomarker for differential diagnosis and disease monitoring. Cerebellar atrophy was examined in 309 patients with autopsy-proven neurodegeneration. Distinct patterns of cerebellar atrophy are found in all pathological subtypes of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Cerebellar atrophy is seen in early-stage (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] \u22641) AD, Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-positive inclusion (FTLD-tau), and FTLD-transactive response DNA binding protein (FTLD-TDP).

        "AbstractText": "The aggregation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides has been confirmed to be associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the three phases of A\u03b2 aggregation, the lag phase has been considered to be the best time for early A\u03b2 pathological deposition clinical intervention and prevention for potential patients with normal cognition. A\u03b2 peptide exists in various lengths in vivo, and A\u03b2 oligomer in the early lag phase is neurotoxic but polymorphous and metastable, depending on A\u03b2 length (isoform), molecular weight, and specific phase, and therefore hardly characterized experimentally. To cope with the problem, molecular dynamics simulation was used to investigate the aggregation process of five monomers for each of the seven common A\u03b2 isoforms during the lag phase. Results showed that A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-38) monomers aggregated faster than their truncated analogues A\u03b2(4-40) and A\u03b2(4-38), respectively. However, the aggregation rate of A\u03b2(1-42) was slower than that of its truncated analogues A\u03b2(4-42) rather than that of A\u03b2pe(3-42). More importantly, A\u03b2(1-38) is first predicted as more likely to form stable hexamer than the remaining five A\u03b2 isoforms, as A\u03b2(1-42) does. It is hydrophobic interaction mainly (>50%) from the interfacial \u03b21 and \u03b22 regions of two reactants, pentamer and monomer, aggregated by A\u03b2(1-38)/A\u03b2(1-42) rather than by other A\u03b2 isoforms, that drives the hexamer stably as a result of the formation of the effective hydrophobic collapse. This paper provides new insights into the aggregation characteristics of A\u03b2 with different lengths and the conditions necessary for A\u03b2 to form oligomers with a high molecular weight in the early lag phase, revealing the dependence of A\u03b2 hexamer formation on the specific interfacial interaction.",

From a drug design perspective, natural products (NPs) are more drug-like and are highly compatible with biological systems compared to most synthetic libraries. NPs provide a more efficient and cost-effective approach to new drug discovery. However, the complexity of NPs makes their identification a challenging task. Chimgin, a bicyclic monoterpene with three chiral centers, exhibits a wide range of biological activity. Despite this, the exact structure of chimgin has remained unclear until now. In this study, we quantified the amount of chimgin in Ferula haussknechtii using analytical Reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detector (RP-HPLC-PDA). Furthermore, we determined the absolute configuration of chimgin through electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Finally, we evaluated its inhibitory effect on AChE through in\u00a0vitro and in silico studies.

Sleep may be altered before the clinical manifestations of some of these diseases appear. Moreover, some sleep disorders affect the physiological organization and function of the brain by influencing gene expression, accelerating the accumulation of abnormal proteins, interfering with the clearance of abnormal proteins, or altering the levels of related hormones and neurotransmitters, which can cause or may be associated with the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms of these effects are unclear. This review mainly focuses on the relationship between and mechanisms of action of sleep in Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety, as well as the relationships between sleep and Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

        "AbstractText": "The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is an optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that passes through each of a set of points in space. The TSP is of interest not only in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering, but also in cognitive and behavioral research to study problem-solving and spatial navigation. Humans are able to complete even complex TSPs with a high degree of efficiency, and distance minimization in TSP analogs has been observed in a variety of nonhuman species as well. Tasks based on the TSP also have the potential for translational research on cognitive and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The current experiment was designed to examine the effects of target number on TSP performance in rats. After pretraining, rats were tested once on each of several target configurations, and their travel routes were recorded. We examined the routes for general efficiency, as well as evidence for strategy use including the nearest neighbor (NN) strategy and crossing avoidance. Our results indicate that latency and route length increase in proportion to the number of targets. Rats also showed a strong tendency to avoid path crossing, and to select NN targets, which strengthened with increasing target numbers. Taken together, our results indicate that travel efficiency decreases linearly in relation to the target number rather than the number of possible routes, which grows factorially with a target number. Additionally, spatial memory and route selection strategy are also affected by an increasing number of targets. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).",

The study evaluated the therapeutic potential of betaine and boric acid (BA) pretreatment administered to rats for 21\u2009days in AD. Then, the rats were sacrificed, and morphological and biochemical analyses were performed in brain tissues. Next, an ex vivo AD model was created by applying amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b21-42) to synaptosomes isolated from the brain tissues. Synaptosomes were analyzed with micrograph images, and protein and mRNA levels of ferroptotic markers were determined. Betaine and BA pretreatments did not cause any morphological and biochemical differences in the brain tissue. However, A\u03b2 (1-42) administration in synaptosomes increased the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member-4 (ACSL4), transferrin receptor-1 protein (TfR1), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and decreased the levels glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx4) and glutathione (GSH). Moreover, ACSL4, GPx4, and TfR1 mRNA and protein levels were similar to the ELISA results. In contrast, betaine and BA pretreatments decreased the levels of ACSL4, TfR1, MDA, and 8-OHdG in synaptosomes incubated with A\u03b21-42, while promoting increased levels of GPx4 and GSH. In addition, betaine and BA pretreatments completely reversed ACSL4, GPx4, and TfR1 mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, betaine and BA pretreatments may contribute to the prevention of neurodegenerative damage by supporting antiferroptotic activities.",

Presently, only symptomatic treatments are available and no disease-modifying drugs are available for AD and other NDs. Thus, targeting AD-associated neuroinflammation with anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants has recently been given much focus. Now, flavonoids are being increasingly investigated as therapeutic agents to treat inflammation; apigenin has a neuroprotective effect. Iron dyshomeostasis plays a key role in sustaining the neuroinflammatory phenotype, highlighting the importance of maintaining iron balance, in which human transferrin (HTF) plays a vital role in this aspect. Herein, we explored the binding and dynamics of the HTF-apigenin complex using multifaceted computational and experimental approaches. Molecular docking revealed that apigenin occupies the iron-binding pocket of HTF, forming hydrogen bonds with critical residues Arg475 and Thr686. Molecular dynamics simulations deciphered a dynamic view of the HTF-apigenin complex's behavior (300 ns) and suggested that the complex maintained a relatively stable conformation. The results of spectroscopic observations delineated significant binding of apigenin with HTF and stable HTF-apigenin complex formation.

SCD patients showed relatively minor surface morphological changes, primarily in the insula and pars triangularis. Furthermore, MCI patients demonstrated reduced volumes in the anterior-superior region of the right hypothalamus, the fimbria of the bilateral hippocampus, and the anterior region of the left thalamus. These observed morphological changes were significantly associated with clinical ratings of cognitive decline. The findings of this study suggest that cortical and subcortical morphometric changes may contribute to cognitive impairment in MCI, while compensatory mechanisms may be at play in SCD to preserve cognitive function.

NP exposure also leads to more secretion of sAPP\u03b2 rather than sAPP\u03b1, leading to increased activation of \u03b2-secretase in NP-received cells.

Cluster analysis identified three cognitive trajectory groups representing steep, n = 77 (7.2%); intermediate, n = 446 (41.8%); and minimal, n = 545 (51.0%) cognitive decline. The steep decline group was older, had more females, APOE e4 carriers and mild cognitive impairment/dementia at last visit; it also showed worse self-reported general health-related and vascular risk factors and higher amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration and white matter hyperintensity positive proportions at last visit. Subtle cognitive decline was consistently evident in the steep decline group and was associated with generally worse health. In addition, cognitive trajectory groups differed on aetiology-informative biomarkers and risk factors, suggesting an intimate link between preclinical cognitive patterns and amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/vascular biomarker differences in late middle-aged adults. The result explains some of the heterogeneity in cognitive performance within cognitively unimpaired late middle-aged adults.",

        "AbstractText": "Gintonin is a new material of ginseng that acts through the ginseng-derived lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor ligand. The gintonin-enriched fraction (GEF) inhibits amyloid plaque accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus, improves cognitive dysfunction by increasing acetylcholine levels, and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. We evaluated the effect of the GEF on the cognitive performance of subjects with subjective memory impairment (SMI). In this eight-week, randomized, assessor- and participant-blinded, placebo-controlled study, participants with SMI were assigned to three groups receiving placebo, GEF 300 mg/day or GEF 600 mg/day. The Korean versions of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (K-ADAS), Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), and Stroop color-word test (K-SCWT) were also evaluated along with the safety profiles. One hundred thirty-six participants completed the study. After eight weeks, we analyzed intergroup differences in primary or secondary outcome score changes. When we compared the GEF group with the placebo group, we observed significant improvements in the K-ADAS and K-SCWT scores. The GEF group did not show a significant improvement in K-MMSE and BDI scores compared to the placebo group. No adverse events were observed in the gintonin and placebo groups for eight weeks. The GEF is safe and effective in improving subjective cognitive impairment related to both the K-ADAS and K-SCWT in this study. However, further large-scale and randomized controlled studies are warranted to secure other cognitive function tests besides the K-ADAS and K-SCWT, and to confirm the findings of the current study.",

Experimental groups composed of a control, vehicle, positive control meditation, and T. triandra extract-treated groups (100, 200, and 400\u00a0mg/kg BW) over 14 days, with scopolamine administration (i.p.) between days 8 and 14. Results showed significant enhancements in the discrimination ratio and spontaneous alteration behavior percentage during novel object recognition (NORT) and Y-maze tests for scopolamine-administered rats treated with T. triandra extract or donepezil. In contrast, open field test (OFT)-assessed spontaneous locomotor activity displayed no significant difference. Notably, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduced significantly in scopolamine-treated rats with T. triandra extract or the positive control. Moreover, neuronal density in the hippocampal CA3 region, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities increased significantly. However, catalase (CAT) activity exhibited no significant difference. In conclusion, T. triandra leaf extract shows promise in mitigating scopolamine-induced memory deficits, potentially attributed to increased neuronal density, inhibited AChE activity, reduced MDA levels, and enhanced antioxidant activities.

One of the most damaging air pollutants is PM2.5 pollution, fine airborne particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter. Exposure to PM2.5 pollution can cause premature death, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, diabetes, asthma, low birthweight, and IQ loss. To avoid these adverse health effects, the WHO recommends that PM2.5 levels not exceed 5\u2009\u03bcg/m3. This study estimates the negative health impacts of PM2.5 pollution in Texas in 2016. Local exposure estimates were calculated at the census tract level using the EPA's BenMAP-CE software. In BenMAP, a variety of exposure-response functions combine air pollution exposure data with population data and county-level disease and death data to estimate the number of health effects attributable to PM2.5 pollution for each census tract. The health effects investigated were mortality, low birthweight, stroke, new onset asthma, new onset Alzheimer's, and non-fatal lung cancer. This study found that approximately 26.7 million (98.9%) of the 27.0 million people living in Texas in 2016 resided in areas where PM2.5 concentrations were above the WHO recommendation of 5\u2009\u03bcg/m3, and that 2.6 million people (9.8%) lived in areas where the average PM2.5 concentration exceeded 10\u2009\u03bcg/m3. This study estimates that there were 8,405 (confidence interval [CI], 5,674-11,033) premature deaths due to PM2.5 pollution in Texas in 2016, comprising 4.3% of all deaths. Statewide increases in air-pollution-related morbidity and mortality were seen for stroke (2,209 - CI: [576, 3,776]), low birthweight (2,841 - CI: [1,696, 3,925]), non-fatal lung cancers (636 - CI: [219, 980]), new onset Alzheimer's disease (24,575 - CI: [20,800, 27,540]), and new onset asthma (7,823 - CI: [7,557, 8,079]).

Subjective PET image quality was scored based on a 5-point Likert scale (poor-excellent: 1-5), and objective image quality was evaluated by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 1 cm3 region of interest (ROI) inside the cerebellum. A\u03b2 detectability was assessed by the calculation of regional standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values in all groups. The Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and paired t-test were performed to compare the subjective scores, SNR, and SUVR values.

        "AbstractText": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, plaque and tangle accumulation trigger an inflammatory response that mounts positive feed-back loops between inflammation and protein aggregation, aggravating neurite damage and neuronal death. One of the earliest brain regions to undergo neurodegeneration is the locus coeruleus (LC), the predominant site of norepinephrine (NE) production in the central nervous system (CNS). In animal models of AD, dampening the impact of noradrenergic signaling pathways, either through administration of beta blockers or pharmacological ablation of the LC, heightened neuroinflammation through increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. Since microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS, it is reasonable to postulate that they are responsible for translating the loss of NE tone into exacerbated disease pathology. Recent findings from our lab demonstrated that noradrenergic signaling inhibits microglia dynamics via \u03b22 adrenergic receptors (\u03b22ARs), suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory role for microglial \u03b22AR signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that microglial \u03b22 adrenergic signaling is progressively impaired during AD progression, which leads to the chronic immune vigilant state of microglia that worsens disease pathology. First, we characterized changes in microglial \u03b22AR signaling as a function of amyloid pathology. We found that LC neurons and their projections degenerate early and progressively in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD; accompanied by mild decrease in the levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite normetanephrine. Interestingly, while 5xFAD microglia, especially plaque-associated microglia, significant downregulated \u03b22AR gene expression early in amyloid pathology, they did not lose their responsiveness to \u03b22AR stimulation. Most importantly, we demonstrated that specific microglial \u03b22AR deletion worsened disease pathology while chronic \u03b22AR stimulation resulted in attenuation of amyloid pathology and associated neuritic damage, suggesting microglial \u03b22AR might be used as potential therapeutic target to modify AD pathology.",

        "AbstractText": "The BrainAGE method is used to estimate biological brain age using structural neuroimaging. However, the stability of the model across different scan parameters and races/ethnicities has not been thoroughly investigated. Estimated brain age was compared within- and across- MRI field strength and across voxel sizes. Estimated brain age gap (BAG) was compared across demographically matched groups of different self-reported races and ethnicities in ADNI and IMAS cohorts. Longitudinal ComBat was used to correct for potential scanner effects. The brain age method was stable within field strength, but less stable across different field strengths. The method was stable across voxel sizes. There was a significant difference in BAG between races, but not ethnicities. Correction procedures are suggested to eliminate variation across scanner field strength while maintaining accurate brain age estimation. Further studies are warranted to determine the factors contributing to racial differences in BAG.",

        "ArticleTitle": "Multi-omics analyses reveal novel effects of PLC\u03b32 deficiency in the mouse brain.",
        "AbstractText": "Phospholipase C gamma-2 (PLC\u03b32) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which subsequently feed into numerous downstream signaling pathways. PLCG2 polymorphisms are associated with both reduced and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and with longevity. In the brain, PLCG2 is highly expressed in microglia, where it is proposed to regulate phagocytosis, secretion of cytokines/chemokines, cell survival and proliferation. We analyzed the brains of three-month-old PLC\u03b32 knockout (KO), heterozygous (HET), and wild-type (WT) mice using multiomics approaches, including shotgun lipidomics, proteomics, and gene expression profiling, and immunofluorescence. Lipidomic analyses revealed sex-specific losses of total cerebrum PIP2 and decreasing trends of DAG content in KOs. In addition, PLC\u03b32 depletion led to significant losses of myelin-specific lipids and decreasing trends of myelin-enriched lipids. Consistent with our lipidomics results, RNA profiling revealed sex-specific changes in the expression levels of several myelin-related genes. Further, consistent with the available literature, gene expression profiling revealed subtle changes on microglia phenotype in mature adult KOs under baseline conditions, suggestive of reduced microglia reactivity. Immunohistochemistry confirmed subtle differences in density of microglia and oligodendrocytes in KOs. Exploratory proteomic pathway analyses revealed changes in KO and HET females compared to WTs, with over-abundant proteins pointing to mTOR signaling, and under-abundant proteins to oligodendrocytes. Overall, our data indicate that loss of PLC\u03b32 has subtle effects on brain homeostasis that may underlie enhanced vulnerability to AD pathology and aging via novel mechanisms in addition to regulation of microglia function.",

        "AbstractText": "Diverse pathogens (viral, bacterial, fungal) have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) indicating a possibility that the culprit may be compromised immunity rather than particular microbe. If true, then vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity might be protective against AD. We estimated associations of common adult infections, including herpes simplex, zoster (shingles), pneumonia, and recurrent mycoses, as well as vaccinations against shingles and pneumonia, with the risk of AD in a pseudorandomized sample of the Health and Retirement Study. Shingles, pneumonia, and mycoses diagnosed between ages 65-75, were all associated with higher risk of AD later in life, by 16%-42%. Pneumococcal and shingles vaccines received between ages 65-75 both lowered the risk of AD, by 15%-21%. Our results support the idea that the connection between AD and infections involves compromised immunity rather than specific pathogen. We discuss mechanisms by which the declining immune surveillance may promote AD, and the role of biological aging in it. Repurposing of vaccines with broad beneficial effects on immunity could be a reasonable approach to AD prevention. Pneumococcal and zoster vaccines are promising candidates for such repurposing.",

        "AbstractText": "The R47H missense mutation of the TREM2 gene is a strong risk factor for development of Alzheimer's Disease. We investigate cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomic changes induced by the Trem2R47H mutation to determine the impacts of this mutation on transcriptional dysregulation. We profiled 15 mouse brain sections consisting of wild-type, Trem2R47H, 5xFAD and Trem2R47H; 5xFAD genotypes using MERFISH spatial transcriptomics. Single-cell spatial transcriptomics and neuropathology data were analyzed using our custom pipeline to identify plaque and Trem2R47H induced transcriptomic dysregulation. The Trem2R47H mutation induced consistent upregulation of Bdnf and Ntrk2 across many cortical excitatory neuron types, independent of amyloid pathology. Spatial investigation of genotype enriched subclusters identified spatially localized neuronal subpopulations reduced in 5xFAD and Trem2R47H; 5xFAD mice. Spatial transcriptomics analysis identifies glial and neuronal transcriptomic alterations induced independently by 5xFAD and Trem2R47H mutations, impacting inflammatory responses in microglia and astrocytes, and activity and BDNF signaling in neurons.",

        "AbstractText": "The absence of a natural animal model is one of the main challenges in Alzheimer's disease research. Despite the challenges of using non-human primates in studies, they can bridge mouse models and humans, as non-human primates are phylogenetically close to humans and can spontaneously develop AD-type pathology. The capuchin monkey, a New World primate, has recently attracted attention due to its skill in creating and using instruments. We analyzed three capuchin brains using structural 7T MRI and neuropathological evaluation. Alzheimer-type pathology was found in one case. Widespread \u03b2-amyloid pathology mainly in the form of focal deposits with variable morphology and high density of mature plaques. Noteworthy, plaque-associated dystrophic neurites, associated with disrupted of axonal transport and early cytoskeletal alteration, were frequently found. Unlike other species of New World monkeys, cerebral arterial angiopathy was not the predominant form of \u03b2-amyloid pathology. Additionally, abnormal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau, resembling neurofibrillary pathology, were observed in the temporal and frontal cortex. Besides, astrocyte hypertrophy surrounding plaques was found, suggesting a neuroinflammatory response. Aged capuchin monkeys can spontaneously develop Alzheimer-type pathology, indicating that they may be an advantageous animal model for research in Alzheimer's disease.",

        "AbstractText": "Cognitive and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) result from brain atrophy and altered functional connectivity. However, it is unclear how atrophy relates to functional connectivity disruptions across dementia subtypes and stages. We addressed this question using structural and functional MRI from 221 patients with AD (n=82), behavioral variant FTD (n=41), corticobasal syndrome (n=27), nonfluent (n=34) and semantic (n=37) variant primary progressive aphasia, and 100 cognitively normal individuals. Using partial least squares regression, we identified three principal structure-function components. The first component showed overall atrophy correlating with primary cortical hypo-connectivity and subcortical/association cortical hyper-connectivity. Components two and three linked focal syndrome-specific atrophy to peri-lesional hypo-connectivity and distal hyper-connectivity. Structural and functional component scores predicted global and domain-specific cognitive deficits. Anatomically, functional connectivity changes reflected alterations in specific brain activity gradients. Eigenmode analysis identified temporal phase and amplitude collapse as an explanation for atrophy-driven functional connectivity changes.",

        "AbstractText": "Brain rhythms provide the timing and concurrence of brain activity required for linking together neuronal ensembles engaged in specific tasks. In particular, the \u03b3-oscillations (30-120 Hz) orchestrate neuronal circuits underlying cognitive processes and working memory. These oscillations are reduced in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, including early cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report on a potent brain permeable small molecule, DDL-920 that increases \u03b3-oscillations and improves cognition/memory in a mouse model of AD, thus showing promise as a new class of therapeutics for AD. As a first in CNS pharmacotherapy, our lead candidate acts as a potent, efficacious, and selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA A Rs) assembled from \u03b11\u03b22\u03b4 subunits. We identified these receptors through anatomical and pharmacological means to mediate the tonic inhibition of parvalbumin (PV) expressing interneurons (PV+INs) critically involved in the generation of \u03b3-oscillations. Our approach is unique as it is meant to enhance cognitive performance and working memory in a state-dependent manner by engaging and amplifying the brain's endogenous \u03b3-oscillations through enhancing the function of PV+INs.",
